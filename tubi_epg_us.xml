    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc>

Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc>

This final episode in the series takes Gordon to the Costa Blanca and a sleepy village that's home to Quelcutti's restaurant and bar, run by the Quelcutti family. Former London cabbie Del and his wife Sue emigrated to Spain 10 years ago with their three children: Joe, Terry and daughter Ruby.  The plan was to retire and live the dream while using their retirement money to set up a business for their kids to run.  Unfortunately, the kids are running the business into the ground.</desc>

    <desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc>

    <desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc>

The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

    <desc>Corruption in the New Orleans Police Department grew like a cancer in the early 1990's.  Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc>

The officers were unharmed, but the brothers escaped and fled the state.  The FBI tracked the two armed men, learning that Chevie and an associate, Daniel Lee, were suspects in a 1996 triple murder in Arkansas.</desc>

    <desc>In the winter of 2001, two well-loved and respected college professors are found murdered in their home.  Nothing about the case makes sense.  No items are missing from the home and the couple had no known enemies.  Local police and FBI agents form a task force to find a pair of homegrown killers and a motive for the brutal crime they committed.</desc>

    <desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc>

    <desc>On the day before Thanksgiving, a mother discovered her 10 year-old son was missing from his school. No one knew how it could have happened.  Within hours, the boy's entire family was frantically searching for him. The few leads in the case quickly turned cold and the FBI was called in to aid in the investigation. The search by agents and local authorities would cover a thousand miles to expose the kidnapper and find the missing child.</desc>

    <desc>El primero de octubre de 1993, un extraño secuestró a Polly Klaas de doce años durante una piyamada en su casa. El FBI de inmediato entró en el caso. Los agentes reunieron fibras de su habitación y descubrieron, a través del uso de fuentes de luz láser, la huella de una palma en la cama de Polly, previamente invisible al ojo humano. Después de una extensa investigación de dos meses, el FBI arrestó a Richard Allen Davis. La impresión de la palma y las fibras coincidieron y Davis fue condenado por secuestro y asesinato.</desc>

    <desc>At 9:30 am on the morning of January 30, 1997, Richmond, VA police respond to a report of shots fired at a local bank.  Two masked men brandishing automatic weapons confront, and open fire on officers responding to the call.  The gunmen exit the bank, and retreat on foot, eventually eluding the officers.  The FBI soon responds, only to find one bank teller dead, another wounded, and the bank's security guard shot four times, yet still alive.</desc>

    <desc>California Highway Patrolman George Gwaltney discovered the body of 23-year-old Robin Bishop near her car on a remote desert highway.  Although he proclaimed his innocence the FBI lab experts were able to link tool marks found on the frame with tools found in Gwaltney's home.  Through the match of hairs and fibers and a unique test for detecting and identifying sperm, Gwaltney was placed at the scene of the crime.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE.

    <desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Priory, a 100-seater carvery in Haywards Heath, Sussex owned by ex IT consultant Scott. The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years. Scott bought the place for £300k but with an ageing clientele eating for half-price, he's losing £5,000 a week.</desc>

This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc>

    <desc>Mark Schaller was new to the Atlanta area. While out one night in early October 2002, Mark began chatting with another patron at a bar. Chatting quickly became something more and that was to Mark’s liking. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something no one could dreamt of. Quinn and Vince are assigned the case. As they dig deeper and deeper into who committed this heinous crime, they soon realize that this was no personal attack and that the killer could be linked to something far greater.</desc>
