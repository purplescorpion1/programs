    <desc>It's the Easter weekend, which means extra time to get out and enjoy the garden. At Longmeadow, Monty plants out sweet peas for summer colour, gives advice on what to use for mulching borders and has plenty of ideas for jobs to get on with this long weekend. Carol Klein is at RHS Rosemoor to revel in the floral spring sensations that epitomise the season. In Scotland, JJ Chalmers explains how important his local park was in helping both his physical and mental rehabilitation.</desc>

After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

    <desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc>

As plans to shut the Midsomer Magna factory are being put into action, Alan's wife Hilary and brother Charles are married in the village church - much to the dismay of Alan's son Ian. In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc>

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc>

Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc>

The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation.

There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death.

    <desc>The double murder of eccentric widow, Isobel Hewitt, and adulterous doctor, Duncan Goff, lead Barnaby and Troy into finding out more about their personal and private lives in the village of Malham Bridge. While Troy suspects an antique dealer that Isobel befriended is the culprit, Barnaby is not convinced, believing anyone the victims knew when they were alive could have been the murderer, from the doctor's wife to the local owner of a restaurant. Even Isobel's close family and members of a local fly fishing group are suspects as they investigate all possible angles.</desc>

    <desc>Joyce is taking part in an open-air art class, being held on the village green of Midsomer Florey, when she discovers the body of an elderly fellow student, Ruth Fairfax, concealed beneath some undergrowth shortly after a session. Just as Barnaby begins to learn that Ruth was not all she seemed to be, officers of the NIS pull him off the case. While Troy is allowed to assist them, Barnaby is left handling a local operation into a spate of thefts, yet he decides to continue his investigations in secret. In doing so, he soon turns up armed robbery, unaccounted stolen money, former criminals, and secret liaisons, before discovering that the NIS investigation is not being as thorough as it should be.</desc>

    <desc>At his family home in Upper Warden, arrogant actor Larry Smith is killed, when a summer house he walks in to as part of a promotion for the sequel to his hit film, The House of Satan, is suddenly destroyed in an explosion. His family quickly fling accusations for his murder directly at the residents of rival village, Lower Warden, leading Barnaby and Troy to determine if this is the case, especially when Larry's director, another member of the family, is electrocuted while using an exercise bike. It's not long before secrets, affairs and blackmail begin to surface from within the two villages.</desc>

With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.

From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.

With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>In the early 1980's, a pair of serial bank robbers gained a reputation among law enforcement officials as formidable bandits.  Using the same modus operandi, the two men took hostages and emptied bank vaults across the Midwest.  After the criminals escaped from police custody, FBI agents familiar with the bandits believed that they would attempt a grand-scale heist.  By conducting surveillance on known associates of the criminals, authorities tried to anticipate the next target.</desc>

    <desc>In the summer of 1988, a wealthy Jackson, Mississippi woman disappeared from her home in broad daylight.  Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc>

    <desc>Tonight, for the first time ever on Kitchen Nightmares, Gordon takes on a nightmare restaurant abroad. La Parra de Burriana is an ex-pat restaurant in Nerja on Spain's Costa del Sol. Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc>

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc>

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.

Two men died and more than a dozen were injured, but Ted Kaczynski wasn't known as the Unabomber until his brother tipped off the FBI. Kaczynski's “Unabomber Manifesto,” published in major newspapers, set off a flurry of activity for the FBI: writing analysis and comparisons, DNA gleaned from a single postage stamp and finally, Kaczynski's arrest at his tiny cabin.</desc>

    <desc>On June 21, 1964, three civil rights workers, two white and one black disappeared in Mississippi while passing through Neshoba County. A massive FBI investigation led to the recovery of the bodies of the slain men and physical evidence was recovered and analyzed. The FBI labs confirmed that all but one of the bullets used to kill the men came from the same gun.   The FBI gained the trust of an informant, whose information led to the conviction of seven local Ku Klux Klan members.</desc>

Two years later a man contacted North Carolina FBI agents with a complex story of conspiracy and murder-for-hire: he claimed he had been hired to murder Wilkey's killer.</desc>

    <desc>Residents of the small town of Noel, Missouri were shocked when one of their banks was robbed.  When the bank president was nowhere to be found, the residents were outraged.  The FBI discovered that things are not always as they appear.  Minute clues led the agents to the body of the bank president.  With no suspects, the FBI relied on dogged determination and modern forensics.  Agents slowly pieced together tiny shreds of evidence.</desc>

    <desc>In 1997, a series of crimes in a small Iowa farming community left residents reeling in shock and fear. Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc>

    <desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.  Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc>

    <desc>Mark Schaller was new to the Atlanta area. While out one night in early October 2002, Mark began chatting with another patron at a bar. Chatting quickly became something more and that was to Mark’s liking. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something no one could dreamt of. Quinn and Vince are assigned the case. As they dig deeper and deeper into who committed this heinous crime, they soon realize that this was no personal attack and that the killer could be linked to something far greater.</desc>
