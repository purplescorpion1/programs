    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>On a dark night in the village of March Magna, Barnaby's wife Joyce swerves her car and narrowly misses a shadowy figure in the road - or so she thinks, when later that night a body is discovered in the old cemetery. The victim was a member of the council who was strange and weird, but someone seemed to have quite a grudge on him, and so Barnaby and Jones delve into his background, and the village, attempting to determine who might have wanted him dead, finding ghosts, grudges, and more beneath the village's surface.</desc>

    <desc>Piano student Zoe Stock has won a place at the Devington Manor Winter School led by internationally renowned musician, Sir Michael Fielding (James Fox). Yet when she is there, things become mysterious when from the river bank in the grounds of the manor she sees a woman jump from the bridge and disappear underwater. When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill. It isn't long, before murder does occur, and the detectives attempt to fathom what occurred in the drowning, and the present day murders.</desc>

    <desc>When Midsomer Morchard's very own boxer, John Kinsella, wins a world title in New York, the success seems to be a joyous time for all, until murder rears its ugly head. When a local solicitor is found dead by his assistant and Kinsella's manager, Barnaby attempts to determine what is going on, and soon discover issues with inheritance, affairs, anger, and gambling to make matters difficult. Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc>
