    <desc>The world is our playground and nobody knows that better than the skiers and riders in Warren Miller’s Playground. Join pioneers like Gretchen Bleiler, Bode Miller, Andreas Hatveit, Mathias Roten, Ueli Kestenholz, and numerous others as they travel around the world from Chile all the way to the sand dunes of Dubai, up to Sweden and the peaks of the Swiss Alps. This year’s invigorating action display includes: a rare and insightful segment on ski racing king and perceived industry bad boy, Bode Miller; a trip to Alaska’s untouched Chugach Range with X-Games Gold Medalists, and brothers, Zach and Reggie Crist; unbelievably deep powder in Utah and British Columbia; and astonishing aerial acrobatics from Sweden, and so much more. PLAYGROUND also highlights the future of snowboarding in a segment featuring the youth-infused Burton Smalls Team in which these young prodigies teach us that size truly isn’t everything.</desc>

Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc>

    <desc>Whilst the Upper Marshwood hunt assemble outside the village inn, a filthy tramp-like man leaves the shop and skulks into the wood.  Soon after, he hears the sound of the hunt begin and the unforgettable noise of the horses and hounds in hot pursuit of the fox.  Running for cover, towards the safety of his home-made shelter, he stumbles and falls into a pit - screaming. LIZA, isolated in the disused railway carriage which constitutes her home, moves deeper into the wood having heard the scream.  She finds the pit and sees the tramp lying crumpled on the ground, clearly dead.  She stares at him for a moment, then turns and walks away.</desc>
