That theory is put to the test when the new sheriff injures his wrist fighting with Ed Bannister (Peter Whitney), who upon learning about it, challenges Robles to a duel.</desc>

This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

    <desc>In this episode, we are back in Missouri on our new farm that we’ve recently purchased. We developed our last farm, and did a 1031 tax free exchange to buy this farm so we can develop and sell it later on. This is the first time we’ve seen the property, so we are finding out what we are going to do with it and how we are going to lay it out. Once we get that figured out, we go into the dirty work of planting, moving box stands, and making sure everything is good for hunting season. Fast forward and we have two amazing hunts where both Ryan and myself take awesome bucks with our bows. This one has it all! Do not miss it!</desc>
