    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>When DCI Barnaby and DS Troy arrive in the sleepy village of Badger's Drift to investigate the sudden death of elderly Miss Emily Simpson, her next door neighbour insists that she had been murdered, after she had seen her return from a walk in the woods, unnerved and shocked by something she had witnessed. When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman. When Hadleigh is found dead the day after Jennings visit, brutally bludgeoned and stripped naked, Barnaby and Troy discover that the victim had many mysteries to him, prompting them to delve into his private life and his past. Matters soon become complicated when Jennings disappears and is later found dead, and a witness recalls seeing a mysterious woman in Hadleigh's house the night before his murder.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>Whilst investigating the murder of Agnes Gray, a quiet animal-loving woman who was bludgeoned to death and found floating in a river near to the village of Ferne Basset, Barnaby gets more than he bargained for when he attends his wife's performance in the Causton Amateur Dramatics' production of Amadeus. When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing. The detective is left wondering who had wanted to turn Esslyn's final act into a true coup de theatre, as he and Troy try to determine what the motive was behind the two murders.</desc>

    <desc>Local villagers in Morton Fendle are up in arms, demanding answers from Alan Hollingsworth, the owner of a local craft centre they had invested in, after news comes out that it has recently fallen into financial turmoil. As tensions begin rising in the village, Barnaby soon suspects that something has happened to Alan's wife, Simone, when his behaviour suddenly changes. His suspicions are soon confirmed when it transpires that Simone was kidnapped, after one of Alan's neighbours is murdered, shortly after witnessing something they shouldn't have.</desc>

    <desc>Following the funeral of local hotelier Karl Wainwright, his hotel's manager and a well liked Punch and Judy performer, Gregory Chambers, disappears unusually in yet another picturesque Midsomer village. Most people dismiss his disappearance completely but when he doesn't turn up, a search is conducted and a severed hand, confirmed to be Gregory's, turns up in the woods. Further deaths and a mushroom poisoning occur surrounding the beneficiaries of Karl Wainwright's will. All is not as it seems.</desc>
