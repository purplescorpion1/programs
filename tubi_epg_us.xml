This final episode in the series takes Gordon to the Costa Blanca and a sleepy village that's home to Quelcutti's restaurant and bar, run by the Quelcutti family. Former London cabbie Del and his wife Sue emigrated to Spain 10 years ago with their three children: Joe, Terry and daughter Ruby.  The plan was to retire and live the dream while using their retirement money to set up a business for their kids to run.  Unfortunately, the kids are running the business into the ground.</desc>

First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc>

Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc>

    <desc>In June 1973, a young girl was abducted from a state park on the Missouri River while camping with her family.  Several months passed with no leads, then an FBI agent took a particular interest in the case.  Using a new technique known as criminal profiling, he predicted that the kidnapper would contact the girl's family on the one-year anniversary of her abduction.  When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.</desc>

    <desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.  Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc>

Through the match of hairs and fibers and a unique test for detecting and identifying sperm, Gwaltney was placed at the scene of the crime.</desc>

He was brutal with his kills and quick in his getaways. Traveling across the country, he struck in Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida. The FBI and local police needed to stop this cross-country killer before more women fell victim to his insatiable rage.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>In 1987, a successful television producer was gunned down in his New York office.  It looked like a professional hit.  With no leads, the investigation stalled.  Four years later and a continent away, a man told Los Angeles police he had been hired to murder two exotic dancers.  Investigators linked the two crimes and uncovered a businessman willing to kill to protect his interests.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>By December 1985, John Gotti had assumed his place as the new Don of the Gambino crime family in New York with the assassination of his boss, Paul Castellano.  The Teflon Don felt secure in his position, always remaining one step ahead of the law.  But he was also the ongoing obsession of Bruce Mouw, leader of an elite crew of FBI agents formed to bring down the Gambino family.  With the help and genius of his Special Projects Squad, bugs were planted in Gotti's most private meeting places.</desc>

    <desc>In 1990 and 1991, Chicago police and the FBI were on the trail of a bank robber whose holdups were becoming increasingly violent.  The criminal consistently used stolen Japanese cars to carry out the robberies, so authorities hoped to identify him by tracking vehicle thefts.  When they finally located the man known as the bearded bandit, they learned that he did not work alone and he had made a pact never to surrender.</desc>

For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.

    <desc>In 1994, a teenage immigrant came to the United States to realize her dream of becoming a doctor.  But a tragic twist of fate intervened, when she found herself an innocent victim of the drug trade.  Kidnapped and held captive, she survived for days against all odds.  Authorities arrested her captors, but they refused to reveal her whereabouts. The FBI and local police raced against time, determined to save the teenager's life. Their investigation revealed a complex story of drugs, betrayal and revenge.</desc>

    <desc>When five-year-old Melissa Brannen disappeared from a Christmas party in December 1989, the only probable suspect was 24-year-old Caleb Hughes.  Hughes reportedly left the party around the time Melissa vanished, but no one saw him with the girl.  Fifty blue acrylic fibers collected during a search of Hughes' car, however, became the major piece of evidence in the case. FBI fiber analysis determined that those fibers were identical to the ones that made up the sweater Melissa was wearing.</desc>

The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.  The FBI's only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc>
