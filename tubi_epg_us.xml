    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

From big college football games to endless oil fields and vast wind farms, Texas is home to more than 30 million Americans. But the state is about more than just big oil, college football and cattle farms - it's also home to some of the best boating in the country. Boasting a myriad of waterways, boaters here enjoy hundreds of lakes, rivers and streams that provide recreational opportunities, abundant wildlife and plenty of fishing. From Austin Texas to San Antonio host Ryan McVinney and the Boat Trader crew explore the laid-back Texas lake life including boat up restaurants along the Colorado River, watersports in Austin and the history of the waterways throughout the region. Boat manufacturers highlighted in this episode are Tige Boats and ATX Surf Boats, two premium Texas-based wake boat brands known for their high-quality, cutting-edge vessels that come equipped with advanced wake shaping technologies and equipment ideal for water skiing, wake surfing and wakeboarding.

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in &quot;fine dining&quot;, he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc>

    <desc>In the summer of 1999, Texas was terrorized by a brutal serial killer who traveled by train.  The FBI assembled a task force to gather information about the dangerous drifter and create a profile that would help locate him.  As they learned that the killer had traveled extensively through the United States and Mexico, the murders became more frequent, and authorities had to cast a dragnet over an entire continent in an effort to catch him.</desc>

    <desc>In July 1996, two men entered a pawnshop in Birmingham, Alabama, and ruthlessly murdered the employees.  Unbeknownst to the killers, a secret video surveillance camera recorded the shooting.  Local police and the FBI released images of the crime to the media, and were quickly able to identify the perpetrators.  Now authorities had to find two cold-blooded killers who knew that they were being pursued for murder one.</desc>

    <desc>In the mid-1990's, a gang of professional bank robbers raided cities across seven states. Disguises and speed protected their identity from cameras and the police as they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, always leaving a bomb to terrorize their victims. The stakes were raised when the FBI discovered the robbers had an agenda beyond their personal wealth. To stop these extremists and their growing operation, the FBI needed to capture their leaders.</desc>
