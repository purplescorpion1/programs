The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc>

    <desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc>

For the last 120 years, The Explorers Club has been the exclusive epicenter where legendary explorers come together to share some of the most incredible adventure stories ever told. From Roald Amundsen’s 1911 voyage to the South Pole to Sir Edmund Hillary’s ascent to the summit of Mount Everest to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin’s history-changing 1969 expedition to the moon, the halls of this institution have echoed with tales of daring discovery and unparalleled human achievement. That’s why we’re beyond stoked to kick off our Huckberry x The Explorers Club partnership—featuring the Land, Sea, and Space Collection from an exclusive Whiskey Peaks collab and a badass grand prize. Tune in now to watch a tour so exclusive, it’s almost like being inducted into the club itself (minus the secret handshake).&quot;</desc>

This is a buck that Jerry passed up last year that he knew held a ton of potential, and after he started getting pictures of him this year, he knew he made the right call. The only problem is that this buck is a traveler and very unpredictable and could be anywhere at anytime. So trying to be in the right spot at the right time proves to be difficult for Jerry.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

    <desc>In Memphis, Tennessee, a horrible crime terrified local residents.  When a wealthy young mother was abducted in front of her in-laws' home, the police had no shortage of suspects.  The twenty-five year old victim left behind a tumultuous marriage, an ex-husband, and several spurned boyfriends.  All were on the FBI's short list.  To find the woman and her abductor, investigators would have to first determine the motive.</desc>

    <desc>On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.</desc>

Two men died and more than a dozen were injured, but Ted Kaczynski wasn't known as the Unabomber until his brother tipped off the FBI. Kaczynski's “Unabomber Manifesto,” published in major newspapers, set off a flurry of activity for the FBI: writing analysis and comparisons, DNA gleaned from a single postage stamp and finally, Kaczynski's arrest at his tiny cabin.</desc>

Scores of police officers and FBI agents converge, determined to find the young girl before it is too late.  When the kidnapper's car is discovered in a field near Lodi, police dogs, helicopters, and hundreds of volunteers are employed in a round-the-clock search.

    <desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc>
