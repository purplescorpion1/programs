    <title>The First Texan</title>
    <desc>Having left his post as governor of Tennessee, Gen. Sam Houston (Joel McCrea) resettles in Mexican territory along the southwest U.S. border. He soon sets his sights on reclaiming the land under the aegis of Texas independence, while romancing post-divorce new love interest Katherine Delaney (Felicia Farr). His efforts eventually lead to the historic Battle of San Jacinto and a very clever bit of battlefield strategy by Houston in his fight against forces led by Gen. Santa Anna.</desc>

    <desc>In the summer of 1988, a wealthy Jackson, Mississippi woman disappeared from her home in broad daylight.  Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc>

The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.
