    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs. Although there is one man who came prepared, Dodgeball Champion Dan Bennett, whose “Duck, Dive, Dip, Dodge and Dunk” training comes into play.</desc>

Other Catwalk moments include the Grandpa in his Red Speedos and a Rainbow Bright Personal Ad. If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper. Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills. The Dizzy Dummy claims its first victim as Dummy Tummy rejects a contestant and the Wipeout Zone becomes a battle of young and old.</desc>

    <desc>It’s no doubt that the ‘Ball Crusher’ Sweeper is the star of tonight’s show. With a brother- sister team hanging by a thread and a three-way hurdle, this week’s Sweeper writes itself into the History books. Tonight is also the night we meet Buffman, a pint sized Superhero with a twitch and a photo finish at the Dizzy Dummy threatens extinction to a Rare Breed. A week of action packed Wipeouts with Latin Dancing lotharios, what more can you ask for? And for the kids, a Fairy Tale, Wipeout Style!</desc>

The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory.

It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies.

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's final programme Gordon returns to Momma Cherri's Soul Food Shack, an intimate forty-seater in Brighton where he oversaw one of the most spectacular changes of fortune at a single venue. Owner CHARITA JONES was producing a menu of irresistible unique classics from the Deep South, but at the same facing financial disaster. The punters were missing, and so was her business acumen. But Gordon succeeded in shutting her out of the kitchen, getting the chef back on the boil and putting the soul back into the business.

Today Charita is fully-booked round the clock and bursting out of the Soul Shack to take on the 110-seater Momma Cherri's Big House. But expansion brings a different set of challenges, and she's still struggling to control her staff and manage her success. Has she got what it takes to make the next step up, or will she be forced to rethink her grand plans?</desc>

    <desc>In tonight's penultimate programme Gordon returns to La Riviera - now renamed Abstract - a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasted top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff, all of them on a mission to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of the haggis. But the locals weren't biting and the restaurant was empty most nights. Gordon's recipe for survival forced them to tone down their act and demystify the menu to get the punters in. Today the restaurant's return to form has led to plans for expansion. Loic is still there, and now he's been promoted to Executive Chef he will oversee any new ventures. But can he continue to resist a return to French frills, and has he managed to pull off his own personal ambition, a Michelin star?</desc>

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

    <desc>The positive impact made by the shooting sports and recreational shooting to people across our country can’t be measured in just one story, so we have three. In Florida, Olympian Dania Vizzi trains at her home shooting facility and talk about how she went from ballerina to one of the best shotgun shooters in the world. In Nebraska, firearms instructor Thea Van Syoc has used the disciplines of competitive pistol shooting and training to help shape her life. Finally we’ll take a look into the National African American Gun Association and learn how one day at the range for Phillip Smith created the fastest growing firearm organization in the United States.</desc>

    <desc>We set out to tell the tale of Marion - and his legendary Mack’s Prairie Wings, smack dab in the middle of the world famous Stuttgart, Arkansas - the land of  ducks and rice. Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc>

    <desc>The positive impact made by the shooting sports and recreational shooting to people across our country can’t be measured in just one story, so we have three. In Florida, Olympian Dania Vizzi trains at her home shooting facility and talk about how she went from ballerina to one of the best shotgun shooters in the world. In Nebraska, firearms instructor Thea Van Syoc has used the disciplines of competitive pistol shooting and training to help shape her life. Finally we’ll take a look into the National African American Gun Association and learn how one day at the range for Phillip Smith created the fastest growing firearm organization in the United States.</desc>

    <desc>We set out to tell the tale of Marion - and his legendary Mack’s Prairie Wings, smack dab in the middle of the world famous Stuttgart, Arkansas - the land of  ducks and rice. Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc>

    <desc>When Midsomer Morchard's very own boxer, John Kinsella, wins a world title in New York, the success seems to be a joyous time for all, until murder rears its ugly head. When a local solicitor is found dead by his assistant and Kinsella's manager, Barnaby attempts to determine what is going on, and soon discover issues with inheritance, affairs, anger, and gambling to make matters difficult. Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc>
