    <title>What Would You Do?</title>
    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

Other Catwalk moments include the Grandpa in his Red Speedos and a Rainbow Bright Personal Ad. If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper.

    <desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

    <desc>When a California man was found dismembered in 1990, police suspected a local burglar, but they couldn't find him.  Six months later, he was caught robbing an Arizona bank and sentenced to life.  But prison couldn't hold him for long, and within a year he escaped.  The FBI would lead a multi-agency manhunt for a killer on a desperate run through the tourist regions of the west.</desc>

    <desc>In Arizona, a shipment of money vanished into the high desert, along with the two men hired to guard it.  The FBI didn't know if the guards were participants or victims of an ambush.  Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizona's northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc>

    <desc>On Mississippi's Gulf Coast, a judge and his politician wife were brutally murdered in their home.  The killer left few clues and the investigation led nowhere.  But the FBI was patiently waiting in the wings.  Once it was determined that federal laws had been violated, they pounced on the investigation. They uncovered a corrupt local government and a group of violent criminal conspirators known as the Dixie Mafia, responsible for fraud, money laundering and murder.</desc>

The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.
