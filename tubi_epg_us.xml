The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc>

    <desc>Both choppers are called to a head-on road smash in the Yorkshire Dales that’s left two pensioners trapped in their wrecked car. Ex Royal Marine pilot Harry swoops on a street in Castleford to drop his medics next to an unconscious cyclist feared to have a brain injury. Paramedics Sammy and Ady find themselves dealing with a difficult patient who insists he wants to climb back on his badly damaged motorbike thanks to bizarre effects of a head injury sustained in the accident. Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car.
