    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc>

Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc>

Former London cabbie Del and his wife Sue emigrated to Spain 10 years ago with their three children: Joe, Terry and daughter Ruby.  The plan was to retire and live the dream while using their retirement money to set up a business for their kids to run.  Unfortunately, the kids are running the business into the ground.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. First up is Mayfair, with a prime location on the busy seafront in Fuengirola, Costa del Sol. The restaurant was set up 28 years ago by 68 year old Londoner Pat and her husband of 45 years, Jack. The good news is that Fuengirola is one of the only towns in Spain that has actually seen an increase in tourists since the recession with 1 and half million Brits visiting last year alone;  the bad news is that Mayfair isn't benefitting. With thousands of hungry sun seekers right on its doorstep, the restaurant should be raking it in - but the place is totally empty.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>World-renowned chef Gordon Ramsay explores new territory in Ramsay's Costa del Nightmares, a four part series that sees him travel to Europe's holiday hotspots. Episode two sees Gordon tackle struggling Le Deck restaurant in Capbreton, a popular coastal town in South West France.  British owners Tim and Debbie emigrated to France 28 years ago, where they met as holiday reps.  Since then they've poured blood, sweat and tears into opening  3 ski restaurants in the Alps.  With the arrival of their children, they set up home by the coast to enjoy the summer months together as a family.  But unable to sit still, Tim launched Le Deck three years ago.  Far from being a hobby, the restaurant has taken over his life.</desc>

After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

    <title>The Texas Rangers</title>
    <desc>The Civil War has ended, the Union Army has pulled out, and now the Texas Rangers are needed once again to protect their state from harm. The newly reformed Rangers decide to take a chance by hiring a notorious outlaw Johnny Carver (George Montgomery). They offer the desperado amnesty for his previous crimes if he'll put his famous trigger finger to work for Texas. Carver agrees, but his new job won't be easy, as his old rival, the Sundance Kid (Ian MacDonald), is out for vengeance.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>In 1992, a young mother was gunned down in front of her children.  Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc>

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego.

    <desc>A California bank manager panics and calls in the FBI after the door to his vault refuses to open.  Upon inspection, the vault has been blasted into from the ceiling, and over $2 million in valuables is gone.  When agents find no clues as to the robbers or their whereabouts in California, they send details of the crime to other FBI field offices.  It is not long before agents in Ohio are investigating a bank vault robbery that is strikingly similar to the California heist.</desc>

    <desc>A Washington DC professor is shot and killed as she tries to get into her car.  The killer leaves the body in the parking lot and drives away in her vehicle.  A week later, a man robs a bank, and security cameras capture the same vehicle as the getaway car.  The FBI believes they are dealing with the same man.  Days later, the same vehicle is involved in a shootout with police, but eventually would elude them.  Eventually, the vehicle is found, the interior covered with red dye from the stolen bank packs.</desc>

    <desc>In June 1973, a young girl was abducted from a state park on the Missouri River while camping with her family.  Several months passed with no leads, then an FBI agent took a particular interest in the case.  Using a new technique known as criminal profiling, he predicted that the kidnapper would contact the girl's family on the one-year anniversary of her abduction.  When this prediction came true, the FBI agent noted behavioral clues, hoping that they could lead him to the kidnapper.</desc>
