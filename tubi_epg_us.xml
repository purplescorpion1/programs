    <desc>Professional dancer Carrie Ann Inaba hosts this show in which a contestant can win $50,000. The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc>

    <title>Monty Don's Italian Gardens</title>
    <desc>Monty Don continues his grand garden tour of Italy. This time he is in Naples to visit some of the most sublime, romantic retreats in southern Italy. After all the formality of the green gardens around Rome and Florence, Monty seeks out idyllic horticultural gems set against the dramatic scenery of the Amalfi Coast to discover why, in the south, gardens are informal and, above all, filled with flowers.</desc>

    <desc>Monty Don concludes his garden tour of Italy in the wealthy north where, in the Veneto and Lucca, extravagant pleasure gardens were created for flirtation and fun. In the Lakes, Monty meets up with the garden society, the Grandi Giardini Italiani, to peer over the fence at luxurious creations of the rich and famous.

    <desc>It's the Easter weekend, which means extra time to get out and enjoy the garden. At Longmeadow, Monty plants out sweet peas for summer colour, gives advice on what to use for mulching borders and has plenty of ideas for jobs to get on with this long weekend.

Chance and Ashleigh Eckert are on their first out-of-state hunt in the rolling hills of Ohio. After overcoming a life-changing kidney transplant, their story is one of faith, love, and resilience. While the goal was a big buck, the true reward was the time spent together and the lessons learned along the way. Because hunting is about so much more than the harvest — it’s about the journey.</desc>

In Florida, Olympian Dania Vizzi trains at her home shooting facility and talk about how she went from ballerina to one of the best shotgun shooters in the world. In Nebraska, firearms instructor Thea Van Syoc has used the disciplines of competitive pistol shooting and training to help shape her life.

We developed our last farm, and did a 1031 tax free exchange to buy this farm so we can develop and sell it later on. This is the first time we’ve seen the property, so we are finding out what we are going to do with it and how we are going to lay it out. Once we get that figured out, we go into the dirty work of planting, moving box stands, and making sure everything is good for hunting season.
