    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

    <desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc>

The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

Upon inspection, the vault has been blasted into from the ceiling, and over $2 million in valuables is gone.

It is not long before agents in Ohio are investigating a bank vault robbery that is strikingly similar to the California heist.</desc>

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc>

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc>

    <desc>Corruption in the New Orleans Police Department grew like a cancer in the early 1990's.  Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc>
