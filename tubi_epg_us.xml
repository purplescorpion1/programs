    <desc>From singing Pastors to Wookies, this week is jammed pack with Characters, who battle it out on the Qualifier with amusing attempts at the inconceivable Field Goal Swing. Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs. Although there is one man who came prepared, Dodgeball Champion Dan Bennett, whose “Duck, Dive, Dip, Dodge and Dunk” training comes into play.</desc>

Other Catwalk moments include the Grandpa in his Red Speedos and a Rainbow Bright Personal Ad. If jumping a revolving arm while balancing on a pedestal above water isn’t enough for you then you’ll love this weeks Sweeper. Contestants are armed with Dodgeballs, to be deployed at each other, creating horrific hits and spectacular spills. The Dizzy Dummy claims its first victim as Dummy Tummy rejects a contestant and the Wipeout Zone becomes a battle of young and old.</desc>

The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies.

For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

    <desc>When the boss of Calder's Biscuit Company is murdered in Copenhagen, Barnaby and Nelson join forces with two female Danish detectives, the abrasive and astute Poulsen and the charming and cool Degn. They discover Eric Calder had more linking him to Copenhagen than just his famous Golden Clusters.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>A disused airfield near Morton Fendle is the location for a romantic evening between young Simon Bright and his girlfriend Laura Sharp - absolutely nothing could ruin their date. The next morning, when Frances Kirby is out for her morning jog, she notices the vintage car they were in up at the airfield, containing Simon Bright's dead body, with Laura nowhere to be seen. Confused, Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby and D.S. Jones can't work out whether it was a suicide pact or murder. Furthermore, they've got to find Miss Sharp and their investigation leads them to linking Simon and Laura with the villagers of Morton Fendle, who met at Elaine Trim's dancing classes. Eventually, the Barnaby family plus Jones make it to a 40s style dance night at the village hall before more villagers start turning up dead.</desc>

    <desc>When Faith Alexander arrives in Midsomer County to meet her long-lost uncle Rex Masters, she gets a shock - Rex's staff had been told that she was dead. Things become even more complex when Rex's body is found in a nearby river, bearing wounds that suggest he was murdered. Barnaby and Jones are soon on the case, trying to establish who would have wanted the elderly man dead. Several people soon come forward with multiple wills, which confuse the matter, but when two more people, close friends of Rex, are also murdered, the investigation raises question on the motive, leading Barnaby to wonder if it was down to finances, passion, or something from Rex's past.</desc>

    <desc>Following the death of Alan King while on a business trip to China, the family company, King's Crystal, is in financial trouble. As plans to shut the Midsomer Magna factory are being put into action, Alan's wife Hilary and brother Charles are married in the village church - much to the dismay of Alan's son Ian. In addition to strife between members of the family, the factory workers are outraged at the loss of their jobs. So when company accountant Peter Baxter is found murdered, Barnaby and Jones suspect a disgruntled employee is to blame. But in order to investigate the matter further, Jones is forced to work undercover, and infiltrate the local group of Freemasons in the village.</desc>

    <desc>The music lovers of Midsomer County are delighted when a host of bands arrives for the Midsomer Rocks festival. Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc>

    <desc>The suspicious death of popular young GP Dr Alan Delaney brings Barnaby and Jones to Midsomer Market to investigate. The detectives are baffled as to a motive for murder - until they consider that the newly engaged Dr James Kirkwood may have been the intended victim. Before long, Barnaby and Jones are heading to Wales - former home to Delyth Mostyn, James's fiancee, to delve deeper into the mystery. There are certainly possible suspects in the murder and attempt on Kirkwood, from Delyth's children, who oppose the engagement, Delyth's husband, and more, as the detectives investigate things, in hopes of uncovering the truth before a major walk is to take place on Mount Snowdon.</desc>

    <desc>In the build-up to Luxton Deeping's annual photographic exhibition, a battle rages between the traditional and digital photographers of the pretty village. The dispute seems harmless enough - until Lionel Bell is found murdered in a nearby woodland, strangled with the cord of his light meter. Barnaby soon gets to work tracking down the killer, but it seems someone is trying to implicate the detective in the murder. And once he is replaced on the case, finding the culprit seems less likely than ever, as his replacement is more concerned of an upcoming wedding than the investigation. Barnaby is forced to work off the case to uncover who is framing him, and who wants dead other photographers in the village.</desc>

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc>

Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter.

    <desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc>

    <desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc>
