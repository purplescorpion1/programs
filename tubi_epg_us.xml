Geoffrey is soon gashed to death after a cricket match in Midsomer Parva, and the locals blame the 'beast of Midsomer'. However, Barnaby - a former spy himself - soon realises that the killing has links to Allenby House and Cold War Berlin, but is initially thrown off the case by MI6. But when a further murder occurs MI6 Agent Glen Jarvis (Neil Stuke) asks Barnaby back on the case.</desc>
