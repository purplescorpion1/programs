Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card.

However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions.

    <title>Elizabeth Montgomery: A Bewitched Life</title>
    <desc>Among the most enduring TV sitcoms of all time, Bewitched remains beloved nearly sixty years after its debut. The series lead, Elizabeth Montgomery, was a complex, strong-willed woman whose life and career became an ongoing quest for love and recognition she never received from her movie star father. Bewitched became one of television's biggest hits during the turbulent 1960s, a time that was symbolic of the series' behind-the-scenes turmoil.</desc>

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.
