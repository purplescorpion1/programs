    <desc>In 1986, a small crime free Indiana town was turned inside out by the arrival of one dangerous stranger. After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest. No one knew where the gunman would strike next, even as his tally of murders and abductions grew. The FBI and state police raced against time to rescue America's heartland from this deranged gunman, before he killed again.</desc>

    <desc>Racial tensions in Buffalo in 1980 were at an all-time high.  Six black males had been brutally murdered--two had their hearts cut out.  The only thing connecting the victims was their ethnicity and the fact that each had been shot with .22 caliber bullets. Residents screamed for the police to stop this serial killer.  With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.  Their analysis paid off.</desc>

    <desc>El primero de octubre de 1993, un extraño secuestró a Polly Klaas de doce años durante una piyamada en su casa. El FBI de inmediato entró en el caso. Los agentes reunieron fibras de su habitación y descubrieron, a través del uso de fuentes de luz láser, la huella de una palma en la cama de Polly, previamente invisible al ojo humano. Después de una extensa investigación de dos meses, el FBI arrestó a Richard Allen Davis. La impresión de la palma y las fibras coincidieron y Davis fue condenado por secuestro y asesinato.</desc>

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc>

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc>

    <desc>On October 2, 1987, a Boston police officer responding to a domestic disturbance call was fatally wounded.
