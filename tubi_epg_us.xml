    <title>Wipeout Australia</title>
    <desc>It’s no doubt that the ‘Ball Crusher’ Sweeper is the star of tonight’s show. With a brother- sister team hanging by a thread and a three-way hurdle, this week’s Sweeper writes itself into the History books. Tonight is also the night we meet Buffman, a pint sized Superhero with a twitch and a photo finish at the Dizzy Dummy threatens extinction to a Rare Breed. A week of action packed Wipeouts with Latin Dancing lotharios, what more can you ask for? And for the kids, a Fairy Tale, Wipeout Style!</desc>

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence.

The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car. On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc>
