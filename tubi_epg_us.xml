    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in &quot;fine dining&quot;, he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc>

    <desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc>

    <desc>The Cape and its surrounding waters are home to great numbers of these purebred watermen, called out to the shoreline and beckoned beyond it at an early age. They are lobsterman and fisherman, the wind and tide as much a part of them as blood and flesh. They are oyster farmers and scallopers, plucking briny jewels from the shallows and great depths.Tied to centuries of tradition and a storied past, these are a few of the many individuals maintaining the legacy of those who live off the sea. They are not merely from the Cape—but its backbone, its core, its spirit, a historic region built and maintained one working day at a time.</desc>

    <desc>The Cape and its surrounding waters are home to great numbers of these purebred watermen, called out to the shoreline and beckoned beyond it at an early age. They are lobsterman and fisherman, the wind and tide as much a part of them as blood and flesh. They are oyster farmers and scallopers, plucking briny jewels from the shallows and great depths.Tied to centuries of tradition and a storied past, these are a few of the many individuals maintaining the legacy of those who live off the sea. They are not merely from the Cape—but its backbone, its core, its spirit, a historic region built and maintained one working day at a time.</desc>

    <desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc>

The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc>

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele.

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc>
