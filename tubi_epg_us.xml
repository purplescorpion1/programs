    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

    <desc>Odion tries to get the good Marik to resist his evil half. As a result, Yami Marik becomes angered, and attacks Odion with the Millennium Rod, which weakens Odion even more. Odion doesn't give up, despite Ishizu's protests. As Marik continues his onslaught (which begins to injure Odion), Odion tells Marik's good side that together, they had conquered his evil half before, and that they could do it again. Then, he tells the good Marik that since Yami Marik was created by the good Marik's hatred, he has the power to destroy him. As Yami Marik raises the Rod to deliver the final blow, the good Marik disappears from the field, and begins fighting against Yami Marik, who struggles for control over Marik's body, and refuses to be defeated. However, Marik's good half stalls Yami Marik long enough for Yugi to activate his spell card. Yugi's Ragnarok spell succeeds in destroying (and removing to the graveyard) Ra, allowing the good Marik to regain control of his body. However, a sliver of Yami Marik reappears on the field, although this time, he is the victim. Yami Marik tries to convince the good Marik to help him seize the Millennium Items and rule the world together, but fails as Marik has decided to stop being evil and make up for his actions. Marik surrenders the duel to Yugi, which sends Yami Marik to the Shadow Realm, ending the Battle City finals.

    <desc>Cully's latest boyfriend, Nico, decides to shadow Troy in preparation for a TV role he recently got, but gets more hands-on experience than he expected when investigations into a slashed painting at a museum in Aspern Tallow, a 17th century portrait of Royalist Jonathan Lowrie, are overshadowed by the murder of his descendant, Marcus Lowrie. It isn't long before Barnaby and Troy, with Nico's assistance, find themselves dealing with mysterious, ghostly events, escaped criminals, and a museum trustee who has more to them than meets the eye.</desc>

    <desc>Hector Bridges, a local magistrate, is infuriated when one of his geese is stolen, just as two bands of travellers arrive in Martyr Warren. Although Barnaby and Troy are called in to deal with the theft and later dissuade him from forcefully evicting the travellers from the village, they soon have a murder on their hands, when a short while later Bridges is killed with his own shotgun. It quickly transpires that many in the village had hated the magistrate, who lied, bullied, and committed many an injustice, leaving the detectives determined to find who among them had pulled the trigger after Bridges pushed them past their breaking point.</desc>

    <desc>Peter and Caroline Cave are house-hunting in Midsomer Newton. Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; &quot;something old and derelict that they can do up.&quot; Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc>

    <desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.  An 11-year-old girl was missing.  Her parents were certain she was no runaway.  When they failed to find her in their quiet Illinois neighborhood, they called the police.  The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc>
