When he’s not rucking to and from the GORUCK HQ, you can find him and his friends putting on grueling garage workouts that are the talk of the neighborhood. Huckberry and GORUCK go way back, we’ve shared plenty of good times, GORUCK Challenges, and (more than) a few beers along the way.

    <desc>Peter and Caroline Cave are house-hunting in Midsomer Newton. Shortly before leaving their hotel they mention they haven't been able to find what they're looking for; &quot;something old and derelict that they can do up.&quot; Anne Merrick tells them about Winyard, a tumbledown cottage in the woods, might be for sale. At the estate agents they are told the house is not yet available for viewing. Later that evening they find the house on their own. However, Caroline has read up on the cottage's haunted reputation and only reluctantly explores it with Peter. The next morning they are found strangled in their own car. DCI Barnaby starts the investigation with the help of PC Ben Jones and they come across the world of estate agents, identical twins, ghosts, piano wire, and more before another body turns up.</desc>

    <desc>On February 12, 1997, two men use a sledgehammer to break into a Camden, NJ home.  The homeowner shoots at the intruders, hitting one in the hand before they escape.  Camden Police respond and track the suspects to a nearby park.  One of the men shoots at the officer before police arrest his accomplice.  The man gives up the identity of the shooter. Twice, police stake out homes where they believe the shooter is hiding, but he eludes them.</desc>
