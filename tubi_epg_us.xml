    <title>What Would You Do?</title>
    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

    <desc>Professional dancer Carrie Ann Inaba hosts this show in which a contestant can win $50,000. The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc>

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

Monty discovers how, like a piece of sculpture, renaissance gardens were created as works of art, and how a group of Edwardian ex-pats mistakenly reinforced the idea that formal Italian gardens were flowerless.</desc>

Barnaby himself is particularly looking forward to seeing recently re-formed rock band, Hired Gun, perform on stage, but he soon gets close to the band for rather unfortunate reasons. During their opening performance, the band's singer, Mimi (Suzi Quatro), falls to the ground dead - electrocuted by a wire that had been run through the microphone stand. Barnaby and Jones soon find the rest of the band could be targets, and when another is killed, questions are raised as to whether former band member, Ginger Foxton, who went missing for 30 years and is presumed dead, is still at large. The detectives soon have to delve into a world of rock music, drug use and greed, to find the truth.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>Four inmates from a Delaware Correctional Center turn up missing in the middle of the night.  A few hours later, a stolen vehicle is recovered; inside, one of the inmate's fingerprints is found, as well as the address book of one of the other fugitives.  A multi-state manhunt ensues with the help of the FBI.  A nearby robbery report is the agent's first tip, followed by a murder in the same neighborhood.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>In February 1988, a record store clerk in Sandusky, Ohio, was fatally shot in his van.  After discovering a night deposit bag with thousands of dollars in the vehicle, police knew that robbery was not the motive, and began to investigate other possibilities.  FBI agents learned that several motorcycle gang members had been stopped nearby on a traffic violation shortly after the murder and theorized that the clerk's murder may have been a botched hit carried out by a gang member.</desc>

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc>

To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains.

Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc>

    <desc>Corruption in the New Orleans Police Department grew like a cancer in the early 1990's.  Lured by the easy wealth of the narcotics industry, crooked cops began breaking the laws they were sworn to uphold. They would stop at nothing, including murder, to protect their rackets. When it became clear they could no longer police themselves, the FBI got involved. Putting their lives on the line, undercover agents devised a way to flush out the violent cops and restore trust in the city's police force.</desc>

    <desc>Residents of the small town of Noel, Missouri were shocked when one of their banks was robbed.  When the bank president was nowhere to be found, the residents were outraged.  The FBI discovered that things are not always as they appear.  Minute clues led the agents to the body of the bank president.  With no suspects, the FBI relied on dogged determination and modern forensics.  Agents slowly pieced together tiny shreds of evidence.</desc>

    <desc>In 1980, the FBI began a massive undercover operation, code named Safebet, that was designed to expose the Chicago Mafia's infiltration into the city's surrounding suburbs. Undercover agents quickly discovered that the mob had its tentacles spread into every facet of the law enforcement community. They unwittingly uncovered the murder of a wealthy socialite perpetrated by a jealous and greedy mob lawyer and covered up by the local police chief.</desc>

    <desc>Beginning in California in 1995, a serial killer targeted vulnerable women. At first charming and generous, he quickly became violent. He was brutal with his kills and quick in his getaways. Traveling across the country, he struck in Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida. The FBI and local police needed to stop this cross-country killer before more women fell victim to his insatiable rage.</desc>

    <desc>Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc>

Captain Russell was a dedicated officer; her friends and colleagues were certain she had not gone AWOL.  FBI agents found her husband, a former Marine, was acting strangely, and a blood-like stain on the couple's floor disappeared before agents could examine it.
