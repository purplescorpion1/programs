For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

With each year before bringing a new twist to the fishery, this season follows suit with a &quot;puddle&quot; of Mahi that leaves the guys scratching their heads.</desc>

Scores of police officers and FBI agents converge, determined to find the young girl before it is too late.  When the kidnapper's car is discovered in a field near Lodi, police dogs, helicopters, and hundreds of volunteers are employed in a round-the-clock search.

Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc>

For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

    <desc>In the early 1980s, the decapitation of a young African-American male led the Miami-Dade police department and the FBI along a trail of murder.  Investigators quickly discovered that the victim was a dissident member of a religious sect headed by a man calling himself Yahweh ben Yahweh, or God, Son of God.  Although the FBI believed Yahweh ben Yahweh and his followers were responsible for many murders, they could find no direct evidence linking them to the crimes.</desc>

    <desc>When police in a small Washington State community began looking into the disappearance of a 22-year-old woman, they had no way of knowing it would evolve into a nationwide hunt for a sexual sadist.  Police knew the killer's identity, but he was a master of disguise.  The FBI was called on to help.  Agents discovered that several unsuspecting women across the northwest had fallen prey to his charms.</desc>

    <desc>A day that began with a class field trip ended with a parent's worst nightmare.  An 11-year-old girl was missing.  Her parents were certain she was no runaway.  When they failed to find her in their quiet Illinois neighborhood, they called the police.  The FBI soon joined the investigation and family and friends worked with detectives and agents in an urgent search for the missing girl.  Faced with conflicting witness reports and false leads, agents wouldn't stop until they found the girl, and the truth.</desc>

    <desc>In June of 1992, masked bandits pulled off a daring mid-day bank robbery.  It marked the beginning of a four-year crime wave that rocked Seattle.  With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc>

With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.
