    <title>Warren Miller's Playground</title>
    <desc>The world is our playground and nobody knows that better than the skiers and riders in Warren Miller’s Playground. Join pioneers like Gretchen Bleiler, Bode Miller, Andreas Hatveit, Mathias Roten, Ueli Kestenholz, and numerous others as they travel around the world from Chile all the way to the sand dunes of Dubai, up to Sweden and the peaks of the Swiss Alps. This year’s invigorating action display includes: a rare and insightful segment on ski racing king and perceived industry bad boy, Bode Miller; a trip to Alaska’s untouched Chugach Range with X-Games Gold Medalists, and brothers, Zach and Reggie Crist; unbelievably deep powder in Utah and British Columbia; and astonishing aerial acrobatics from Sweden, and so much more. PLAYGROUND also highlights the future of snowboarding in a segment featuring the youth-infused Burton Smalls Team in which these young prodigies teach us that size truly isn’t everything.</desc>

    <desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc>

Days later, the same vehicle is involved in a shootout with police, but eventually would elude them.
