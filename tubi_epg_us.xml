After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc>

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses.

It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from &quot;tomato and cointreau soup&quot; to &quot;pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce&quot;.

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc>

    <desc>On a summer night in 1990, a body was discovered burning in a Minnesota alley.  Weeks later, police finally identified the victim, a suspected drug courier from California.  The FBI began working with local police and slowly uncovered a multi-state crime ring run by a deadly drug lord who used violence and intimidation to keep those around him silent.  Agents needed to infiltrate and dismantle the crew before more people died.</desc>

The Teflon Don felt secure in his position, always remaining one step ahead of the law.  But he was also the ongoing obsession of Bruce Mouw, leader of an elite crew of FBI agents formed to bring down the Gambino family.  With the help and genius of his Special Projects Squad, bugs were planted in Gotti's most private meeting places.</desc>

    <desc>On the day before Thanksgiving, a mother discovered her 10 year-old son was missing from his school. No one knew how it could have happened.  Within hours, the boy's entire family was frantically searching for him. The few leads in the case quickly turned cold and the FBI was called in to aid in the investigation. The search by agents and local authorities would cover a thousand miles to expose the kidnapper and find the missing child.</desc>

    <desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc>
