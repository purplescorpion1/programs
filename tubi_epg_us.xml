    <desc>As the SoCal Bluefin Tuna fishing season begins to take shape, Ali and Rush head out to fish the waters of San Diego and see what new surprises may be in store for them this year. For many boats in the fleet, the heading turns to the south for a visit to the commercial tuna pen operation that often attracts other fish from miles away. It's parking lot fishing at its best, but with a change in technique and break from the crowd Ali puts Rush on the bite!</desc>

    <desc>When it comes to fishing and the marine industry, we are often more united by the Bluefin tuna than we think. For Ali Hussainy, the Bluefin is responsible for fueling his life long passion as an angler, and in this episode he gets to share that passion with two friends that have their own ties to the species. For wildlife biologist Forrest Galante and master sushi chef Hiroyuki Terada, catching a bluefin tuna on rod and reel will be a first!</desc>

This event offers a unique opportunity for the sport fishing community to create meaningful connections with our nation's heroes while raising awareness of the challenges they sometimes face when transitioning back to civilian life. With a little bit of luck and a lot of teamwork, Ali and Rush hope to put their veterans on a Bluefin tuna bite they won't forget!</desc>

Ali and Rush switch their targets from the jumbo size Bluefin Tuna to a smaller, medium grade fish for non-stop run and gun action. But, with so many fish fixated on the masses of bait in the area, it may take a million casts to pull one out of the froth.</desc>

Disguises and speed protected their identity from cameras and the police as they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, always leaving a bomb to terrorize their victims.

Within hours, the boy's entire family was frantically searching for him. The few leads in the case quickly turned cold and the FBI was called in to aid in the investigation. The search by agents and local authorities would cover a thousand miles to expose the kidnapper and find the missing child.</desc>
