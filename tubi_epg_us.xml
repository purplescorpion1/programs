    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is Piccolo Teatro, a bijou vegetarian restaurant in Paris run by feisty Scot Rachel. A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is Piccolo Teatro, a bijou vegetarian restaurant in Paris run by feisty Scot Rachel. A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's penultimate programme is The Curry Lounge in Nottingham, the city with more restaurants per square mile than any other in Britain. This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc>

Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away.

    <desc>Not my first trip to Texas, but my first chance to get a Texas buck did not disappoint on this trip. What started off as just a waterfowl photography shoot turned into an opportunity for me to grab a buck tag/license. No fence, low fence, or high fence…. Texas has some great hunting! There isn’t too many warm whitetail hunts that can be me excited but bonus hunts will get me every time!</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Fish &amp; Anchor, a restaurant and bar near Lampeter in rural West Wales, owned and run by ex-boxer Mike and his wife Caron. Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure. Every night they go twelve rounds with the local clientele who are fast deserting them to the tune of a ~£1,000 per week loss.</desc>

    <desc>The venue is The Runaway Girl, a tapas bar-cum-nightclub in Sheffield city centre on the brink of collapse. The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc>

    <desc>In Lincoln County, Nebraska, a fugitive drug dealer engaged in a shootout with state troopers, wounding two of them, and eluded capture after a high-speed chase.  Authorities immediately set up a statewide manhunt, connecting the fugitive to a murder in western Nebraska.  A chance sighting led FBI agents to a second confrontation with the killer, who was more determined than ever to escape the law.</desc>

    <desc>In Memphis, Tennessee, a horrible crime terrified local residents.  When a wealthy young mother was abducted in front of her in-laws' home, the police had no shortage of suspects.  The twenty-five year old victim left behind a tumultuous marriage, an ex-husband, and several spurned boyfriends.  All were on the FBI's short list.  To find the woman and her abductor, investigators would have to first determine the motive.</desc>

Eluding authorities, they moved from state to state in a wave of abduction and car theft.  When a foreign military officer disappeared along their trail, police and FBI agents wondered if the armed fugitives had become killers.

    <desc>In February 1988, a record store clerk in Sandusky, Ohio, was fatally shot in his van.  After discovering a night deposit bag with thousands of dollars in the vehicle, police knew that robbery was not the motive, and began to investigate other possibilities.  FBI agents learned that several motorcycle gang members had been stopped nearby on a traffic violation shortly after the murder and theorized that the clerk's murder may have been a botched hit carried out by a gang member.</desc>
