    <desc>When DCI Barnaby and DS Troy arrive in the sleepy village of Badger's Drift to investigate the sudden death of elderly Miss Emily Simpson, her next door neighbour insists that she had been murdered, after she had seen her return from a walk in the woods, unnerved and shocked by something she had witnessed. When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc>

Also present is disgraced ex-policeman Jack Colby, a former colleague of Barnaby's – but Jack refuses to talk to his old friend. When Jack is murdered, the detective must delve into the dark secrets in the victim's past. There are certainly dark secrets to uncover, and Barnaby has to determine whether the victim's part in a scandal years earlier at Causton police station, is key to the mystery behind his death. It isn't long before he finds that Eddie Marston is attempting blackmail, and soon murdered as a result, and that Lord Holm is in love with Jack's wife, psychotherapist Gina.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The venue for tonight's final programme is The Granary in rural Hampshire, an upmarket restaurant which - at 200 seats - is the biggest Gordon's ever taken on. Originally opened by entrepreneur Nigel Nieddu as an up-market dining club four years ago, the restaurant was relaunched after a ~2m refit, but it's still losing ~4k a week. It promises classy modern British cuisine but in reality the fussy menu features food sourced from all over the globe and the locals, disconcerted by its exclusive reputation, are staying far away. Head Chef Martin doubles as parole officer to his unruly teenage charges in the kitchen, while Nigel stubbornly struggles to contain the front-of-house chaos that he's created.</desc>

    <desc>In the early 1990's drug gangs terrorized Harlem, New York neighborhoods. When a 10-year-old boy fell victim in the crossfire, NYPD detectives and FBI agents clamped down on the problem. They formed a task force called C-11, designed to dismantle the gangs. In an environment of violence and fear it would be difficult to identify, arrest and convict those involved in the secretive and deadly world of big money drugs.</desc>

They would try to ferret out these heavily armed criminals who moved in a shadowy underworld and were not afraid to kill authorities.</desc>

Una investigación del FBI a gran escala llevó a la recuperación de los cuerpos de los hombres asesinados y la evidencia física fue recuperada y analizada. Los laboratorios del FBI confirmaron que todas excepto una de las balas usadas para asesinar a los hombres provenían de la misma arma.  El FBI se ganó la confianza de un informante, cuya información condujo a la condena de siete miembros del Ku Klux Klan local.</desc>

    <desc>Beginning in California in 1995, a serial killer targeted vulnerable women. At first charming and generous, he quickly became violent. He was brutal with his kills and quick in his getaways. Traveling across the country, he struck in Mississippi, Louisiana and Florida. The FBI and local police needed to stop this cross-country killer before more women fell victim to his insatiable rage.</desc>

    <desc>By April of 1995 in Washington, D.C., two officers had been shot and one had been murdered. Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc>
