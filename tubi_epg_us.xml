    <desc>In tonight's second programme Gordon tackles a pub for the first time, getting to grips with The Fenwick Arms in rural Lancashire. The pub is run by landlord Brian who, after thirty years in the business and a quadruple heart-bypass, still puts in 120 hours a week and insists on laying down the law in the kitchen. Despite their best endeavours Brian and his partner Elaine are ~£250k in debt, losing ~1500 a week and facing bankruptcy within three months unless there's a drastic reversal in their fortunes.</desc>

After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

    <desc>When a California man was found dismembered in 1990, police suspected a local burglar, but they couldn't find him.  Six months later, he was caught robbing an Arizona bank and sentenced to life.  But prison couldn't hold him for long, and within a year he escaped.  The FBI would lead a multi-agency manhunt for a killer on a desperate run through the tourist regions of the west.</desc>

Six people died and more than a thousand were injured in the bomb blast that tore a 5-story crater in the building.  During the investigation, the twisted fender of a rental van was extracted from the rubble.  The FBI was able to determine from where the van was rented and by whom.  Undercover agents then made their arrests within six days of the bombing.</desc>

With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.  The effort put them face to face with an armed and desperate fugitive.</desc>

Disguises and speed protected their identity from cameras and the police as they stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, always leaving a bomb to terrorize their victims. The stakes were raised when the FBI discovered the robbers had an agenda beyond their personal wealth. To stop these extremists and their growing operation, the FBI needed to capture their leaders.</desc>

With no suspects, local investigators turned to the FBI.  Profilers were able to produce a psychological composite of the type of person the killer would most likely be.
