    <desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc>

    <desc>Mark's quest for the South America Waterfowl Slam has now taken him to Peru where he finds a surprising density of Cinnamon Teal. Although he already checked this species off the list in Argentina, his first hunt in Peru proves to be one of the best Cinnamon Teal shoots of his life. This is only the first afternoon and there are 5 days left to hunt the remaining 7 species.</desc>

    <title>The Journey Within</title>
    <desc>In this episode, Mark Peterson chases after a Red Stag, Black Buck and Fallow deer. There’s no shortage of action in this video. Argentina's borders were closed during the peak of COVID, so these animals have not been hunted for two years, which led to a game rich environment and excellent trophy quality. On this adventure, Mark is joined by his dad Earl, brother Aaron and nephew Alec to chase some of the biggest free-range Red Stags in the world. Stay tuned for more on this family adventure in Argentina.</desc>

South Dakota is well known as the pheasant hunting capital of the world, but with its rolling prairie lands, also holds great habitat and numbers of prairie chicken and sharp-tail grouse. Take a look as Mark chases both and find out if he connects.</desc>

    <title>Chasin' The Sun</title>
    <desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc>

Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc>

But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc>

    <title>Helicopter ER</title>
    <desc>Both choppers are called to a head-on road smash in the Yorkshire Dales that’s left two pensioners trapped in their wrecked car. Ex Royal Marine pilot Harry swoops on a street in Castleford to drop his medics next to an unconscious cyclist feared to have a brain injury. Paramedics Sammy and Ady find themselves dealing with a difficult patient who insists he wants to climb back on his badly damaged motorbike thanks to bizarre effects of a head injury sustained in the accident. Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car. On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc>

Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.

Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc>

    <desc>In Anchorage, Alaska, a young mother and her two daughters were sexually assaulted and brutally murdered.  There was only one piece of forensic evidence: a washrag carrying pubic lice that the killer used to clean himself after the crime.  Employing an unusual and original method, an FBI expert combed through all the hairs and fibers in the apartment.  He was not only able to determine how long each hair had been there, but which hairs came from the killer and how the crime proceeded.</desc>

    <desc>A cunning predator was loose in rural South Carolinaabducting young women from their own front yards in broad daylight.  He was also a sadist, calling one victim's family, taunting them, boosting and then dashing their hopes.  Local investigators called on the FBI to help them find this clever serial killer.  Like a game of chess, FBI profilers and forensic examiners were able to outwit the killer, and put an end to his deadly game of cat and mouse.</desc>

    <desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc>

    <desc>In 1997, a series of crimes in a small Iowa farming community left residents reeling in shock and fear. Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc>

    <desc>In the summer of 1988, a wealthy Jackson, Mississippi woman disappeared from her home in broad daylight.  Left behind was a mysterious ransom note listing twelve names and no specific instructions.  The note, and a few drops of blood were the only clues to her fate. FBI and local police struggled to find answers in the cryptic message so they could find the kidnapper and retrieve the victim before her time ran out. Solving the crime required the keen insight of a criminal profiler and the perseverance of a family, local authorities, and the FBI.</desc>

Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizona's northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc>
