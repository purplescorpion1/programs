    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is Ruby Tates in Brighton, owned and run by ex-actor and failed Hollywood wannabe ALLAN LOVE. Situated in an affluent and trendy area just one street back from the beach, it's an oyster bar and seafood restaurant but Allan's never tasted the food because he hates fish.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's programme is The Priory, a 100-seater carvery in Haywards Heath, Sussex owned by ex IT consultant Scott. The former chapel of a nineteenth-century convent, the restaurant is in a spectacularly beautiful location and offers bargain roast dinners from a carvery that's been running for twenty years. Scott bought the place for £300k but with an ageing clientele eating for half-price, he's losing £5,000 a week.</desc>

A former waitress at the restaurant, Rachel bought it three years ago and now, along with best friend Stephanie, she's trying to convert the carnivorous French into a nation of veggies. For Gordon it's a sentimental journey to the city where he spent his formative years as a chef, a food mecca full of gastronomic delights that should be a dream.</desc>

This 120-seater Indian restaurant has been run since January by ex sales director Raz who's new to the business - and it shows. Despite a ~500k refurbishment and décor like a Bollywood set the honeymoon period's well and truly over. His once-healthy trade is evaporating and at his current rate of loss it's uncertain he'll make it past Christmas.</desc>

    <desc>Saturday night at The Glass House Restaurant in Ambleside was a disaster.  Orders in the kitchen were mixed up, the food wasn't cooked properly and the customers were complaining.  Not only was the chef in tears, but the owners were on the brink of bankruptcy.   

A few months on, there have been some departures from the Glass House. Who is in charge of the kitchen now? And, more importantly, is Ramsay's Caesar salad still on the menu?</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc>

    <desc>Nick and Richard are self-confessed restaurant virgins.  They've both had successful careers in the brewery business so when they bought Moore Place they believed they could make it an instant success.  What they hadn't realized was just how difficult it would be to fill the 90-seater oak-paneled restaurant and how hard it would be to find a chef who could cook decent food.

Has Ramsay's fast-track guide to restaurant success helped these brewery whiz-kids transform their failing ex-Berni Inn into a profitable business? And is the building still painted that disgusting shade of purple?</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The episode that has gone down in TV history. Tim Gray was the 21 year-old Head Chef at Bonaparte's in Silsden, West Yorkshire. Claiming to specialise in &quot;fine dining&quot;, he had ambitions to be a TV chef and dreamed of opening restaurants in London, Paris and New York. Unfortunately, Tim couldn't even cook an omelette and his trademark scallops made Ramsay throw up. A true kitchen nightmare if ever there was one.

With no customers and a fridge full of fancy ingredients, Bonaparte's was losing money fast. Ramsay soon established that what the people of Silsden really want to eat is Beef and Ale Pie and Treacle Tart. Ramsay soon had the restaurant chocker block but what state is it in now?</desc>

    <title>Operation Exeter: Undercover Senior Year</title>
    <desc>Exeter, California is a rural town of 10,000 residents and a thriving high school drug trade. Police officer, Alex Salinas, a baby-faced 22-year-old newly graduated from the Academy, poses as a high school senior who lands himself in detention to set up drug buys with fellow students. He purchases marijuana, cocaine, hydrocodone, and other drugs, which leads to the arrest of 13 students. When the amount of drug trafficking is uncovered, it's a wakeup call for the community and the students themselves.</desc>

    <desc>The Port of New Orleans is the stage for an operation aimed at union extortion. FBI agents go undercover to infiltrate the lucrative cargo ship cleaning business enabled by illegal payments and false paperwork. Through a fabricated Trojan-horse cleaning operation, agents uncover a drug-infested underworld of racketeering and kickbacks to dodge taxes and regulations. The operation closes down an illegal industry making millions from government loopholes and fabricated documents.</desc>

    <desc>U.S. Customs spearheads a sting aimed at Mexican bankers laundering money for the Cali and Juarez cartels. Customs sends agent William Gately undercover to infiltrate the financier's ranks, posing as money launderers. They bribe bankers and launder more than $100 million through Mexican financial institutions. In the end they disrupt the cartels operations and the U.S. government freezes accounts totaling more than $110 million. The operation leads to the arrests of 167 people, including 26 Mexican bankers.</desc>

Authorities have known about the Iceman's talents for some time, but no one could have guessed how many people this mild mannered family man has killed.

    <title>Operation Payclip: Bribery In The Big Easy</title>
    <desc>The Port of New Orleans is the stage for an operation aimed at union extortion. FBI agents go undercover to infiltrate the lucrative cargo ship cleaning business enabled by illegal payments and false paperwork. Through a fabricated Trojan-horse cleaning operation, agents uncover a drug-infested underworld of racketeering and kickbacks to dodge taxes and regulations. The operation closes down an illegal industry making millions from government loopholes and fabricated documents.</desc>

    <title>Operation Casablanca: Tracing The Cali Cartel's Cash</title>
    <desc>U.S. Customs spearheads a sting aimed at Mexican bankers laundering money for the Cali and Juarez cartels. Customs sends agent William Gately undercover to infiltrate the financier's ranks, posing as money launderers. They bribe bankers and launder more than $100 million through Mexican financial institutions. In the end they disrupt the cartels operations and the U.S. government freezes accounts totaling more than $110 million. The operation leads to the arrests of 167 people, including 26 Mexican bankers.</desc>

    <desc>During a volatile period of organized crime, ATF agent Dominick Polifrone assumes the role of a &quot;wise-guy&quot; to gain the confidence of and incriminate the mafia's most prolific hitman, Richard &quot;The Iceman&quot; Kuklinski. Authorities have known about the Iceman's talents for some time, but no one could have guessed how many people this mild mannered family man has killed. In a bold attempt to build a case, Agent Polifrone befriends the man many have called &quot;the devil himself.&quot;</desc>
