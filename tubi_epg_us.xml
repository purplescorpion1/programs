    <desc>On a summer afternoon in upscale Lodi, California, a 12-year-old girl is abducted from her home.  Scores of police officers and FBI agents converge, determined to find the young girl before it is too late.  When the kidnapper's car is discovered in a field near Lodi, police dogs, helicopters, and hundreds of volunteers are employed in a round-the-clock search.  It would take a community united in concern for one of their youngest to find the missing child.</desc>

The killer taunted his victims, hunting them like animals before shooting them down.  He was at home in the rugged terrain.

    <desc>In Arizona, a shipment of money vanished into the high desert, along with the two men hired to guard it.  The FBI didn't know if the guards were participants or victims of an ambush.  Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizona's northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc>

    <desc>In 1992, a young mother was gunned down in front of her children.  Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc>

    <desc>In November of 1994, when a Wells Fargo armored van disappeared from a Glendale, Arizona mall, local authorities and the FBI scrambled to recover it, and its cargo of nearly a million dollars. Six hours later, agents found the van, its driver shot dead inside and the money gone. It was a perfect hit by professionals who left no clue behind. Months passed before a solid lead developed. In January, a tip led agents to look into a former prison guard.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>Piano student Zoe Stock has won a place at the Devington Manor Winter School led by internationally renowned musician, Sir Michael Fielding (James Fox). Yet when she is there, things become mysterious when from the river bank in the grounds of the manor she sees a woman jump from the bridge and disappear underwater. When Barnaby and Jones start investigating the possible drowning, they discover unsavoury connections to the past that could prove lethal 20 years later, especially when someone attempts to kill. It isn't long, before murder does occur, and the detectives attempt to fathom what occurred in the drowning, and the present day murders.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>When Midsomer Morchard's very own boxer, John Kinsella, wins a world title in New York, the success seems to be a joyous time for all, until murder rears its ugly head. When a local solicitor is found dead by his assistant and Kinsella's manager, Barnaby attempts to determine what is going on, and soon discover issues with inheritance, affairs, anger, and gambling to make matters difficult. Meanwhile Kinsella's trainer Teddy Molloy (Phil Daniels) has his own hidden agenda. When a re-enactment of a Victorian boxing match gets heated, and Kinsella's manager is found dead in his home's gym, the pair attempt to determine who is responsible, although Barnaby's judgement seems to be clouded on this one.</desc>

The final blow leaves the pickaxe impaled through her heart with such force that it is embedded into the floor. The police uncover an unlikely suspect - a petite woman who claims to get sexual satisfaction from killing.</desc>
