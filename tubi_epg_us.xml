    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

Although Barnaby and Troy are called in to deal with the theft and later dissuade him from forcefully evicting the travellers from the village, they soon have a murder on their hands, when a short while later Bridges is killed with his own shotgun. It quickly transpires that many in the village had hated the magistrate, who lied, bullied, and committed many an injustice, leaving the detectives determined to find who among them had pulled the trigger after Bridges pushed them past their breaking point.</desc>

    <desc>It's a good day for the Hicks family, as the name of Tommy Hicks - who was executed during World War I for &quot;cowardice and desertion&quot; - is added to the list on Midsomer Parva's war memorial. Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc>
