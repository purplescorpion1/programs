    <desc>This week contestants on Wipeout Australia are bought undone by a seemingly simple obstacle on the Qualifier, the Slippery Stairs. It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc>

    <desc>Hunting has a way of grounding us, reminding us of what truly matters: shared moments and unforgettable memories. Chance and Ashleigh Eckert are on their first out-of-state hunt in the rolling hills of Ohio. After overcoming a life-changing kidney transplant, their story is one of faith, love, and resilience. While the goal was a big buck, the true reward was the time spent together and the lessons learned along the way. Because hunting is about so much more than the harvest — it’s about the journey.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>After debating on who their next guest speaker should be, the Midsomer Worthy Writers' Circle decide to invite famous writer, Max Jennings, to their next meeting, despite opposition to the choice by Gerald Hadleigh, the group's chairman. When Hadleigh is found dead the day after Jennings visit, brutally bludgeoned and stripped naked, Barnaby and Troy discover that the victim had many mysteries to him, prompting them to delve into his private life and his past. Matters soon become complicated when Jennings disappears and is later found dead, and a witness recalls seeing a mysterious woman in Hadleigh's house the night before his murder.</desc>

    <desc>Whilst investigating the murder of Agnes Gray, a quiet animal-loving woman who was bludgeoned to death and found floating in a river near to the village of Ferne Basset, Barnaby gets more than he bargained for when he attends his wife's performance in the Causton Amateur Dramatics' production of Amadeus. When Agnes's cousin, Esslyn Carmichael, inadvertently cuts his own throat during the final act, it's quickly discovered that the tape on the prop blade he had used was removed without anyone knowing. The detective is left wondering who had wanted to turn Esslyn's final act into a true coup de theatre, as he and Troy try to determine what the motive was behind the two murders.</desc>

    <desc>Local villagers in Morton Fendle are up in arms, demanding answers from Alan Hollingsworth, the owner of a local craft centre they had invested in, after news comes out that it has recently fallen into financial turmoil. As tensions begin rising in the village, Barnaby soon suspects that something has happened to Alan's wife, Simone, when his behaviour suddenly changes. His suspicions are soon confirmed when it transpires that Simone was kidnapped, after one of Alan's neighbours is murdered, shortly after witnessing something they shouldn't have.</desc>

Although there was uncertainty as to whether it was the result of an accident or murder, Barnaby and Troy find themselves having to determine which it was, when Ian Craigie, the commune's leader, is stabbed to death with a carving knife a few days later, while attending a spiritual seance with the rest of the commune and the parents of one of its members. It's not long before they discover hidden truths about the commune's founding and some of its members.</desc>

    <desc>When DCI Barnaby and DS Troy arrive in the sleepy village of Badger's Drift to investigate the sudden death of elderly Miss Emily Simpson, her next door neighbour insists that she had been murdered, after she had seen her return from a walk in the woods, unnerved and shocked by something she had witnessed. When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc>

This is Lois and Peter's first venture into the catering industry - the happily married couple used to enjoy eating in restaurants, so thought it might be fun to own one. 18months later their dream has turned into a nightmare and they're loosing ~£4,000 a month.</desc>

    <desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc>

The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.
