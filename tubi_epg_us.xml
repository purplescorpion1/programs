    <title>MasterChef</title>
    <desc>The Top 10 participate in the season’s most crucial team challenge when the MASTERCHEF JUNIOR restaurant opens its doors to a special group of VIP female role models. The team that dishes up the most impressive meal will go straight into the Top 8, but it’s going to take more than skill to win over this exclusive group of guests. The losing team will face a Gordon Ramsay masterclass in which they will be tasked with replicating a three-Michelin-star-rated dish. See who advances.</desc>
