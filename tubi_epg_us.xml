    <desc>Professional dancer Carrie Ann Inaba hosts this show in which a contestant can win $50,000. The contestant, known as the One, competes with a mob of 100 other players by answering questions. When the One answers correctly, each member of the mob that answered incorrectly is eliminated. The One earns money for each mob member who is eliminated. If the One can eliminate the entire mob, he wins $50,000. But if the One gets a question wrong, he is eliminated and the remaining mob members split his winnings.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's first programme is La Lanterna in Letchworth, Hertfordshire. Twenty-eight-year-old owner and head chef Alex offers modern Italian cuisine, a taste of Little Italy in England's first garden city, and the restaurant is run by his best mate maitre dé Gavin, helped by his ex-air hostess girlfriend Emily. But Alex has no customers, cookers that don't work and an expensive menu that's about as authentically Italian as a spag bol.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's second programme is D-Place in Chelmsford, Essex run by Mexican-born Israel and his English partner Tara. They've sunk ~£150,000 of their own money into their trendy café bar which offers a vast selection of fusion cuisine. In charge is Executive Chef Philippe, producing everything from all-day breakfasts to hoi sin noodles with an astounding lack of flair; the plastic food is dire and boomerangs back from the dining room as soon as it's cooked.</desc>

Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars.

Anthony Gant, shot during a major event being held in the village green, in view of many.

    <desc>Claude Dallas lived the life of a cowboy.  A loner and distrustful of authority, he lived off the land, poaching wildlife and selling the hides.  But when two game wardens confronted Dallas about his deeds, they were shot and killed.  After a massive manhunt, Dallas was captured and convicted, only to escape months later.  Making the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list, Dallas eluded the law for almost a year until the FBI tracked him down in a small town in California.</desc>

    <desc>In Puerto Rico, the death of a government witness, and the suspicious circumstances surrounding it, lead the FBI and local authorities to suspect corruption in the highest levels of the police force. With the help of a cooperating witness, investigators find the scope of the corruption is far greater that they first thought. Authorities struggle to capture the rouge officers, men who once swore to uphold the law, but now use their power to commit heinous crimes.</desc>

    <desc>After a series of brutal bank robberies and murders in south Miami during the mid-1980's, the FBI embarked on an exhaustive eight-month investigation.  With little evidence and no suspects, agents were willing to try anything to find the violent perpetrators.  On April 11, 1986, agents conducting routine surveillance spotted the vehicle used in the bank robberies.  They attempted to arrest the two suspects in the car.  What followed was the bloodiest firefight in FBI history.</desc>

    <desc>Beginning in summer of 1990, the bodies of several women began turning up in and around the city of Vienna, Austria. From an extensive investigation by the Viennese police, it was determined that these murders were the work of one sadistic predator.  Europe was dealing with a serial killer.  With no experience with this kind of predator, Viennese police turned to the FBI. FBI profilers were able to identify a suspect in the murders.  More ominously, they linked this same killer to murders committed in the United States.</desc>

The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc>

An employee believed she recognized the voice of one of the robbers, and FBI agents began conducting surveillance on a former employee of the facility.

With each new robbery, the bandits perfected their craft, leaving behind no evidence and escaping with hundreds and thousands of dollars.  As the robbers became increasingly violent, pressure mounted to end their reign.  With few leads, the FBI forced their own luck.

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>The venue for tonight's fourth programme is La Riviera, a fine dining restaurant in Inverness. Owned by multi-millionaire Barry Larson and costing ~£8000 a week to run, the place boasts top French chef Loic Lefebvre and an impeccably-trained kitchen staff with Michelin star-studded backgrounds. Loic is on a mission, to bring sophisticated French cooking to the home of haggis, tatties and deep-fried Mars bars. But though he's hungry for success, he's French, he's arrogant and the food's pretentious.</desc>

    <desc>The venue for tonight's program is Clubway 41, despite being voted Blackpool Tourist Board Restaurant of the year, the place is dire straits. It is the prime example of HOW NOT TO RUN A RESTAURANT. Owner DAVE is the flakey self-appointed head chef, who hasn't been in a kitchen for 30 years and can't cook. His partner DAWN invents bizarre dishes for the menu, ranging from &quot;tomato and cointreau soup&quot; to &quot;pork with brie, nectarine and whiskey sauce&quot;. Gordon faces a hellish week, Clubway 41 is breaking every rule in book, can he bring Dave, Dawn and their food back to earth?</desc>

She constantly bickers with her son whilst the customers are forced to wait hours for their fluorescent crab stick paellas, and stodgy carbonaras from Oscars &quot;bit of everything&quot; menu.</desc>

    <desc>In Washington D.C, a car bomb takes the life of a former ambassador and his secretary.  The FBI is on the case and begins sifting through layers of a wide-ranging conspiracy.  The scope of the investigation broadens when it becomes apparent that a foreign government, ruled by a ruthless dictator, ordered the attack.   Agents and prosecutors must engage in a political tug-of-war to uncover the identities of the assassins.</desc>
