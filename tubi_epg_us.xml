    <desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc>

    <desc>There’s nothing like a change in weather conditions to wreck a perfectly good fishing plan, and that’s exactly what Capt. Justin Leake and his cousin encounter when December turns unseasonably warm. It’s a grey morning with thick fog so Justin and Capt. Brent Berry won’t be heading offshore right away as planned. Instead, Justin turns to his Humminbird CoastMaster charts to pinpoint a near shore artificial reef just five minutes from the St. Andrews Pass, where the anglers will do a little fishing until the fog burns off. Capt. Leake opts to send a jig to the bottom and he’s not very picky about the one that gets tied on. “When fishing reefs, the specific jig doesn’t matter because it’s all about the presentation,” he says. “When you’re sitting on top of a wreck, break out the ‘junk jigs’ – they get bit just fine.” And that proves to be the case as Justin and Brent enjoy non-stop battles against amberjack, red snapper and bonita. And with a bite this good, there’s no reason to go anywhere else! Also, we take a look at the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary’s new paddle craft safety initiative.</desc>

    <desc>We set out to tell the tale of Marion - and his legendary Mack’s Prairie Wings, smack dab in the middle of the world famous Stuttgart, Arkansas - the land of  ducks and rice. Get an inside look at a man that many consider to be larger than life, from those that knew him best, like his cousin and fellow hell raiser, Bud McCollum. We’ll even hear a story or two from Milton Stovesand, an 81 year old former waterfowl guide and Mack’s employee who actually guided John Olin a time or two, and ran the timber holes with Marion. It’s timber holes and tall tales. It’s cups of coffee and cupped up wings. It’s partners in business, and partners in potholes and it’s pure Arkansas...just like Marion.</desc>

    <desc>Shotgun sports are experiencing unprecedented growth, with competitions across the country gaining popularity as enthusiasts vie to be the best shooters in the world. Every summer, the Amateur Trapshooting Association hosts The Grand American in Sparta, Illinois. This year marks the 125th Anniversary for the largest trap shooting competition in the world. We’ll talk with the people who make this tournament run behind the scenes and explore what makes this tournament such a special event. We’ll also look at the rich history of The Grand. On-site we’ll chat with the curator of the Trapshooting Hall of Fame and look at some of the incredible historical pieces on display in the museum. Additionally, we’ll learn about White Flyer and how the clay manufacturer has made important innovations for the shotgun sports.</desc>

Following an explosion in a truck that had been stored in a truck depot, a body is soon discovered in a nearby lake, which turns out to be Alec Grainger, who had been seen arguing with James Parkes (Joseph Millson), the son of Colonel Matt Parkes (Tim Pigott-Smith). James appears to be involved in shady business deals and is blamed by his grandmother Caroline Halsey (Judy Parfitt) - and others - for the suicide of a woman he got pregnant two years before. Barnaby and Jones find themselves delving into a mixture of fraud, smuggling, and lies, trying to piece together the truth.</desc>

    <title>The FBI Files</title>
    <desc>By April of 1995 in Washington, D.C., two officers had been shot and one had been murdered. Each had been sitting in their patrol cars when a man sneaked up and opened fire. The FBI was brought in to help catch the cop killer.  Agents identified the man who was most likely the killer, but he was nowhere to be found.  Months of surveillance operations around the country finally yielded a break; they found their suspect in Baltimore, MD.</desc>

Mike, a self-taught cook, is a one-man pressure cooker in the kitchen as he struggles to accommodate a vast menu while Caron's unique style of front-of-house management includes abusing the customers and her husband in equal measure.

The restaurant is losing money by the bucket-load and the two best friends who run it are at war with each other. The owner Justin Rowntree won't listen to reason, and his head chef and best friend Ritchie has had enough. To make matters worse the credit crunch has hit and there is fierce competition from corporate chains. 

Gordon is on hand to help the friend's weather the storm with a credit crunch menu solution designed to take on the chains, but can Gordon save Justin's failing business, and prevent his friendship with Ritchie ending up in tatters?</desc>

    <desc>The Dovecote is a bistro in the heart of rural Devon run by a family at breaking point. The restaurant is on its last legs - they've run out of customers, money and hope. Enter Gordon, who on his first visit to the bistro is confronted with hideous wallpaper, vacuum packed lamb and a pig-headed head chef and owner who can't face up to his mistakes. Gordon has a torrid time putting them on the road to recovery, but come the autumn, they are sticking to his rules and business is looking brighter. 

With the advent of the credit crunch, soaring food prices, thrifty clientele and unrelenting competition from the high street chains, Gordon is determined to galvanise the owners, the staff and the local community to ensure their survival and keep customers coming back for more.</desc>

    <desc>The Walnut Tree Inn was in big trouble - there was no head chef, the customers had dwindled, and the owner had been forced to sell the family home to keep the business afloat.
Set in beautiful Welsh countryside, The Walnut Tree Inn was a successful business for 37 years and became a national institution. But when Francesco bought the place 3 years ago he made the mistake of turning the warm and welcoming country inn into a cold and stark London-style restaurant. And when things went wrong he tried to run the kitchen as well as the front of house.
With its Michelin star in jeopardy, Ramsay's first job was to recruit a new head chef so the owner could concentrate on customers. But has Francesco managed to follow Ramsay's advice and stop meddling in the kitchen?</desc>

    <desc>Both choppers are called to a head-on road smash in the Yorkshire Dales that’s left two pensioners trapped in their wrecked car. Ex Royal Marine pilot Harry swoops on a street in Castleford to drop his medics next to an unconscious cyclist feared to have a brain injury. Paramedics Sammy and Ady find themselves dealing with a difficult patient who insists he wants to climb back on his badly damaged motorbike thanks to bizarre effects of a head injury sustained in the accident. Flying doctor Jez is confronted by a baffling whodunnit after a man is accidentally shot at a firing range. A jockey thrown by his galloping horse amazes the team with his toughness as he undergoes treatment on a broken bone without even flinching. Meanwhile, a crash outside one of Yorkshire’s most famous stately homes leaves a man with a chronic medical condition trapped in his upturned car. On the moors, paramedics Pete and Lee rescue an off road biker injured when his motorcycle toppled off a rock.</desc>
