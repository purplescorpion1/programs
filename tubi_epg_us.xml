It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc>

With the rut in full swing, seeing bucks isn't usually a problem. But getting in range of a big mature buck can be a challenge. Mark spots the mature deer he wants to pursue and spends all of his time trying to get.</desc>

As a non-resident, Mark had less than a 1% chance to draw this tag with Worldwide Trophy Adventures (WTA) TAGS Program. This is why he loves the tag system, you never know when you're going to get a tag. This area provides one of the best elk tags in the state of Nevada. Mark is bringing his brand new Gunwerks Nexus 300 PRC rifle to the high mountains of the Nevada desert.</desc>

    <title>The Journey Within</title>
    <desc>Mark Peterson heads south to Florida after an alligator. On this adventure, Mark is toting his Gunwerks BlastR handgun as he hunts the swamps with his sights set on a big mature gator. Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc>

Their focus is now set on pursuing a Northwestern Whitetail in the picturesque landscapes of Montana. This is Mark’s second attempt at this particular subspecies, with his initial endeavor taking place in Saskatchewan – a contrast in hunting styles. In Saskatchewan, they utilized ground blinds, while in Montana, the strategy is centered around the art of spot and stalk. One of the aspects that Mark finds particularly captivating about the Deer Slam is the diverse hunting styles each state employs, adding a unique dimension to his hunting experiences.</desc>

Alligators are typically judged in the field by looking at the distance from their eyes to the tip of their nose. The rule of thumb is that they grow a foot in length every year until they are eight years old, then grown an inch per year after that. At 13 feet 3 inches, this old gator is one for the books.</desc>

When the post mortem confirms her death was no accident, the pair discover that nothing is what it seems to be within the little village as they try to find out what exactly she saw. Their investigation introduces Barnaby and Troy to many eccentric and quirky residents and soon turns up a web of sex, blackmail and lies, and the possibility that the murder could be connected to a shooting accident two years ago, which claimed another woman's life.</desc>

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.
