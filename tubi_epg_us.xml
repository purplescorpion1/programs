    <desc>It's a good day for the Hicks family, as the name of Tommy Hicks - who was executed during World War I for &quot;cowardice and desertion&quot; - is added to the list on Midsomer Parva's war memorial. Tommy's son Lionel and grandson Dave, mayor of Causton and whom Barnaby does not like (owing to dodgy building work by the mayor's company), are thrilled, but the snooty Hammonds are decidedly less pleased. Henry, the patriarch of the Hammond family, is particularly riled by his insalubrious neighbours, and has nurtured a long-running feud with the Hickses. But the evening after a battle re-enactment in the village, Henry is murdered - and Barnaby must delve into the history of the two families to find the killer, discovering a web of fraud, lies, and hidden truths.</desc>

How far would the protesters go to prevent the bypass being built? And do current events somehow relate to the death of Michael Wilson many years earlier?</desc>

    <desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

    <desc>In 1986, a small crime free Indiana town was turned inside out by the arrival of one dangerous stranger. After an officer was gunned down at point-blank range, the psychotic killer led investigators across the Midwest. No one knew where the gunman would strike next, even as his tally of murders and abductions grew. The FBI and state police raced against time to rescue America's heartland from this deranged gunman, before he killed again.</desc>

    <desc>In the early 1990's drug gangs terrorized Harlem, New York neighborhoods. When a 10-year-old boy fell victim in the crossfire, NYPD detectives and FBI agents clamped down on the problem. They formed a task force called C-11, designed to dismantle the gangs. In an environment of violence and fear it would be difficult to identify, arrest and convict those involved in the secretive and deadly world of big money drugs.</desc>

    <desc>In 1997, a series of crimes in a small Iowa farming community left residents reeling in shock and fear. Two young men went on a crime spree of robbery, kidnapping and murder, and then disappeared. By the time they were identified, they already had a twelve-hour lead. As the hunt for the two men expanded, the FBI committed its resources to tracking down the suspects. The pursuit would take agents across six states to catch the killers before they struck again.</desc>
