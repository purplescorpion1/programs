    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

The morning started off good with warmer temperatures and multiple turkeys gobbling on the roost. After setting up in the hardwoods on the edge of a field, a few longbeards pitch down and come straight to the call. It results in a quick hunt on a beautiful morning. To become a member of TFT, and to support its many conservation efforts to ensure we have healthy turkeys populations in the future, click the link below.</desc>

After a tough stretch hunting in Mississippi, the crew heads back down to Florida to try to get some momentum going again. After a tough start to the hunt, Jordan is joined by Austin Riley of the Atlanta Braves on a different piece of ground. The hunting was slow overall, but Jordan and Riley did spot a longbeard way off in a cow pasture. The next morning, everything changed and it was a gobbling frenzy. The gobbler ended up walking off with some hens, but they didn't give up. A mid-morning move ended up paying off and the shot was almost missed by the cameraman.</desc>

    <desc>The residents of Milton Cross, a feudal estate with a church, farms, houses and acres of land, depend on lord of the manor Edward Milton for their livelihoods. But when Sonia Woodley is stabbed in the churchyard two years after the death of her abusive husband Gerald, Barnaby and Jones investigate, trying to work out who killed her. It soon becomes clear someone took a pair of tailor scissors to do the deed, but who amongst the villagers could have done so, is unclear, and the investigation is complicated, when the pair learn the local Anglican priest, the parish vicar, had received a letter from Sonia. When he himself is killed, the pair believe something in the letter may be key to solving the mystery.</desc>

    <desc>Barnaby is not convinced about Mayor David Hicks' plans to revive an annual trip to Brighton, suspecting his proposal to buy coastal land there, is rather a fraudulent scheme. Naturally, he joins the trip, but during their time in Brighton, a hated property developer (Tim McInnerny) is beheaded on a ghost house ride, prompting Barnaby to team up with his cousin to determine whether the developer's renters, the mayor, a gloomy reverend (Mark Gatiss), or the lady of a large estate are responsible, and soon discovers a hotbed of jealously, debt, lies and more, conceal a far darker secret.</desc>

Answers lay somewhere in the thousands of square miles of Arizona's northwest territory.  When the vehicle was recovered with three hundred thousand dollars and the drivers missing, suspicions that the crime was an inside job grew.</desc>
