    <title>What Would You Do?</title>
    <desc>Using hidden cameras, host John Quiñones observes and comments on how ordinary people behave when they are confronted with dilemmas that require them either to take action or to walk by and mind their own business. Various scenarios are created that force people to make split-second -- and often surprising -- decisions, and variations of the situation (such as changing the genders, races or clothing of the people involved) are often featured to see if different reactions are elicited. Examples of situations on the show include a waitress being harassed by her boss, and a drunken valet trying to park cars.</desc>

    <desc>This week Gordon is at a god-awful Italian restaurant in Derby. La Gondola is stuck in a time-warp with naff Seventies cuisine, bad net curtains and no customers. New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

    <desc>A California bank manager panics and calls in the FBI after the door to his vault refuses to open.  Upon inspection, the vault has been blasted into from the ceiling, and over $2 million in valuables is gone.

It is not long before agents in Ohio are investigating a bank vault robbery that is strikingly similar to the California heist.</desc>

    <desc>From May until July of 1984, Alton Coleman and his common law wife, Denise Brown, engaged in a gruesome crime spree that spanned six states and left eight people dead including children.  The FBI coordinated law enforcement efforts throughout the entire country in order to track the couple.  Their expertise in conducting manhunts for the nation's most horrible killers paid off.  The couple was located and apprehended as they prepared to kill again.</desc>

    <desc>On August 20, 1980, an unseen sniper murdered two young black men as they jogged with two white women in Salt Lake City, Utah.  Police threw all their resources into finding a killer who left almost no clues behind.  They met with FBI agents and detectives from around the country who had similar racially motivated sniper slayings.  A month later, working off little more than a possible license plate number, police in Kentucky arrested Joseph Paul Franklin but the man escaped from custody.</desc>

    <desc>The rapes and murders of ten women near Tampa, Florida in 1984 had the authorities puzzled and the community scared.   Since the beginning, the FBI had been analyzing the crime scene evidence and had found a common link: red trilobal carpet fibers.  But there was no suspect, until one of the killer's potential victims survived.  Through her interviews and the cooperation of local authorities and the FBI, 31-year-old Bobby Joe Long emerged as the prime suspect.</desc>

In a small Ohio community, an elderly woman and a teenage boy disappeared within hours of each other.  Police believed the cases were linked, but didn't know how. They contacted the FBI for help.

    <desc>In 1971, John List left a note with the bodies of his mother, wife and three children in his mansion ballroom right before he disappeared. Eighteen years later, all detectives had to work from is an outdated photograph of List. &quot;America's Most Wanted&quot; commissioned an age-scaled bust of List to help viewers in identifying the confessed murderer.</desc>

    <desc>When a decomposed body is found stuffed in a barrel, it's easy to presume murder. But the body had been placed in the barrel 30 years earlier. One of the few clues was an address book found along with the body, but years of moisture had washed away the ink, which was completely gone. Scientists desperately searched for a way to reveal the information written on the pages of the address book.</desc>
