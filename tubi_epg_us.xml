The trash talk is as fierce as the competition and continues to the Wipeout Zone with the winner taking not only the $20,000 but also the glory.

It’s all in the name really, an innocent set of stairs, covered in Wipeout Crash cream. Its up the way and down the way for all and sundry. The lucky 12 that move through, battle it out with a giant toothbrush Sweeper. ‘Nat with the Tats’ and Renee ‘Lets get physical’ move through to the Dreadmill, flying the banner for the ladies. Look out for Scotty Six Toes at the Big Balls and get the ear plugs ready as you meet Herr Chris. It’s a colourful week with leotards, laughs and lots of ladies.</desc>

    <desc>Mesmerized by Bon Bon’s Belly Dancing, we catch up with our favourite Big Balls in the Qualifier. They dish out punishment to Australia’s very own female Jim Carrey and send Big Cat tamer Robbie into the pond. Goofy Goggles up the ante on the Dreadmill causing the Breakdancing Dad to create hilarious new moves. Golden Guns, Marisa battles it out for the ladies against Perfect Specimen, Seamus in the Wipeout Zone.</desc>

    <desc>Wipeout Australia debunks the myth that only young, fit and funky people should go on game shows. This week we are forced to take notice of Demolition Dave, a 49 yr old South Australia man who thanks to some home training smashes the qualifier. For those lucky enough to survive the Fly Screen Sweeper it was Dizzy Dummy time. Emerging as the Dark Horse, Kobie Mulligan earned herself a shot in the Wipeout Zone, joined by a Strategist and Rubber Woman resulting in a bitter showdown.</desc>

Its no easy task to earn a spot in the Wipeout Zone this week with the Dreadmill, sorting the men from the boys. Contestants must dodge the wrecking ball while shooting basketballs.

    <desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's programme Gordon finds a chef caught in a time warp when he tackles a picturesque but largely unfrequented upmarket restaurant in King's Lynn, a traditional market town on the Norfolk coast. For the last eighteen months ex Michelin-starred chef Nick has owned and run Rococo but his past success is now eluding him. The menu is past its sell-by date, the service is stuffy, the food is over-priced and the only thing being fed is his ego. Yet, despite debts of ~£100k and the prospect of putting his home at risk and his young family on the streets, Nick continues to cook comatose in a 1990s fantasy land of his own making.</desc>

    <title>Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares</title>
    <desc>In tonight's final programme of the series Gordon grapples with girl power when he takes on an intimate family-run restaurant in the heart of WAG territory near Liverpool. For the last three years Morgan's has been run by antiques dealer-turned-restaurateur SANDY and her two daughters HELEN and LAURA. The beautifully-designed dining room has a prime high street location and should be the perfect eatery for the trendy local clientele. But Head Chef Phil is grappling with an eclectic menu that includes mashed potato with apricots and his cooking's just not up to it.</desc>

He called it Nilo, which was also Olin’s model of conservation. Today, Nilo is still considered one of the most prestigious hunting and shooting preserves in the nation.

    <desc>In July 1996, two men entered a pawnshop in Birmingham, Alabama, and ruthlessly murdered the employees.  Unbeknownst to the killers, a secret video surveillance camera recorded the shooting.  Local police and the FBI released images of the crime to the media, and were quickly able to identify the perpetrators.  Now authorities had to find two cold-blooded killers who knew that they were being pursued for murder one.</desc>

    <desc>When a Delaware woman vanished in 1996, family and friends discovered her secret life.  The appointments secretary to the Governor had carried on an illicit affair with a wealthy married man.  Agents suspected that her powerful ex-lover was responsible, but they had little physical evidence to support their theory.  Investigators never found the woman's body or the murder weapon.  The FBI's only hope was to go undercover, and turn brother against brother.</desc>

    <desc>In Wisconsin, a varsity athlete is blindfolded, gagged, and shoved into a van by four gunmen.  The kidnappers contact the victim's family and demand $30,000, but offer no instructions on how to transfer the money.  The victim's family contacts the police.  The boy's captors tell his family they have shot him, and will kill him if they do not receive their money.  At an agreed upon drop site, FBI agents approach the captor's vehicle, only to watch them flee and quickly be followed by authorities.</desc>

    <desc>In the early 90s, Washington, D.C. police were losing the battle against street gangs who enforced their territories with lethal violence.  The homicide rate in the nation's capital climbed to the highest in the country.  Local police turned to the FBI for help, but agents soon found themselves in the direct line of fire.  In the fall of 1994, a gang member walked into police headquarters, killed two FBI agents and one detective, then turned the gun on himself.</desc>

    <desc>El 21 de junio de 1964, tres defensores de los derechos civiles, uno blanco y uno negro, desaparecieron de Mississippi mientras cruzaban el condado de Neshoba. Una investigación del FBI a gran escala llevó a la recuperación de los cuerpos de los hombres asesinados y la evidencia física fue recuperada y analizada. Los laboratorios del FBI confirmaron que todas excepto una de las balas usadas para asesinar a los hombres provenían de la misma arma.  El FBI se ganó la confianza de un informante, cuya información condujo a la condena de siete miembros del Ku Klux Klan local.</desc>

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal.

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence.
