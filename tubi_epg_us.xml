    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>Barnaby and DC Ben Jones (Jason Hughes) find themselves attempting to unravel the deaths of a choir tenor, and later a bird watcher, before more murders occur. The case is complicated by a rivalry between the Midsomer Worthy and Aston Wherry choirs, due to compete in an upcoming competition, and suspicions that an art scam is to be conducted, and soon Barnaby and Jones become concerned about a local woman, who they fear may become a victim herself. Particularly when it becomes clear the bird watcher had been photographing suspicious activity of late.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>A few months ago, Annie Woodrow was arrested, accused of murdering her friend, Frances Trevelyan, on the motive of wanting Frances' husband. Her time in court has come, but DCI Barnaby is certain she still is holding things back in regards to the murder, and decides to monitor the trial. Yet a chance remark by Frances' youngest daughter, and a meeting with an old friend and psychiatrist, makes him begin to doubt the evidence for her conviction. Soon he and DC Jones, awaiting news of his promotion to DS, find themselves reinvestigating the case, and it soon becomes clear that they may have missed details that could implicate another in the murder.</desc>

    <title>Midsomer Murders</title>
    <desc>The double murder of eccentric widow, Isobel Hewitt, and adulterous doctor, Duncan Goff, lead Barnaby and Troy into finding out more about their personal and private lives in the village of Malham Bridge. While Troy suspects an antique dealer that Isobel befriended is the culprit, Barnaby is not convinced, believing anyone the victims knew when they were alive could have been the murderer, from the doctor's wife to the local owner of a restaurant. Even Isobel's close family and members of a local fly fishing group are suspects as they investigate all possible angles.</desc>

    <desc>In 1992, a young mother was gunned down in front of her children.  Police searched for answers, but found none. The horrible crime appeared unmotivated, senseless, and random. Then, family members offered a startling clue.  The victim, the wife of a prominent Atlanta attorney, was also a woman burdened with a secret; a secret the FBI believed led to her death.  It would force local and federal agents to untangle an intricate web of money, drugs and murder.</desc>

New owner Daniela bought the place because she got married there back in the day but her sentimentality has blinded her to the fact that she's bagged a white elephant. Gordon's biggest problem is head chef Steve, one of the worst he's ever met, and one who'd rather open a tin of tuna or a packet of soup than create a proper meal. Can Gordon get the kitchen cooking again and save La Gondala from sinking?</desc>

Nestling among the cafes lining the seafront offering all-day English breakfast and chips, La Parra is the brainchild of twenty-six-year-old ex-nightclub manager Laurence. He set himself up in business eighteen months ago with a loan from his dad and, although he's not an experienced chef, mans the kitchen on his own, determined to offer something better than chips to his largely British clientele.</desc>
